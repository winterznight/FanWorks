# Control

Dr. Tim, sub-land. So there *maybe* could have been a conversation about how Tim in this world could be just utterly *kick ass* as a civilian. But, considering the intensity of his career and subsequent addition when considering vigilante and superheroes become involved, it would make sense for him to need to give up control once and awhile. However, be warned, this is reality in their world. It’s not always nice and mentions of hard things Tim faces as well as his boyfriends are there.

\*\*

So.

When Dick casually mentioned, “*I have ****gags****, Tim. I’m not afraid to use them,*” he didn’t think this might be a statement his vigilante boyfriend would feel the need to *prove*.

He is unavoidably *incorrect*.

(And God *help him*. He never *knew* how good it could be.)

\*\*

And there’s something about *control* they talked about long before everything started to *move* in this crazy direction; it was back when they contacted him in the extremes. It was when Jason’s ripe viscera spilled out of his body cavity on Tim’s kitchen table, babbling in Arabic about something utterly fucking *terrifying* called the Demon’s Trap and snapping the spine at a perfectly symmetrical angle. N was talking low, soothing, holding the flailing arms down in a tight lock, braced on his hip against the Red Hood’s side to keep his legs wound up, immobile long enough for the good doctor to *get with the impromptu surgery*. *Chop, chop*.

(Oddly enough, it’s how he’d also met Robin--a moment in the *extreme*, and even *then*, the little shit was calling for a Dr. Thompkins and sneering at him with bared teeth. He got the asshole back in the best of ways--doing a perfect, textbook job so the former Boy Wonder healed *flawlessly* and without even a scar to show for it.)

It was back far enough that he knew better than to ask any *questions* about anything he overheard. It was when any small talk had to be stilted, had to be about him and his week, before he could get to *know* them.

With N and Hood literally laying on his table and blood on his favorite WoW t-shirt, he’d started talking to cut through the whole *killing people is fine* babble (N is already used to *those* little diatribes apparently). At *that* juncture, the murder vibe had still scared the ever-loving *bejesus *out of him.

(But when N called him, said *immediately*, “I’m going to ask, Timmy, but you should say *no*,” he knew things were going to get...messy. But the Red Hood being balls deep in *killing* instincts? Not what he would have necessarily *imagined.* Still, he would *never* turn them away.)

And because Hood’s eyes were...*changing* with the whiteouts up and the terrible injury that pretty much *gutted *him looking better and better, he would *swear* those eyes were getting more...green. Some self-preservation instinct kicked in, made him start talking along the same vein. The abused housewife he’d seen come in, hadn’t reported anything because she begged him and he was too young to think it was his business. When they brought her back in a body bag the next time, he’d made himself go downstairs to the basement and assist in the autopsy. The story only made him pause, made Hood blink up at him woozily, eyes *blue* again.

It was just something to keep Hood from coming off the table to snap his neck, to *talk*, remind the vigilante where he was at the moment. So the doctor hastily started in about the control it *takes* to hold something like this in your hand, something fragile, something that can be fixed or broken so *easily*. Holding life *in the palm of his hand*.

It’d been stupid, really, going through his steps and processes before he assesses and begins treatment, talking about the necessary caution and control. He’d been trying to work fast and efficient, variables and possibilities, a plan of action to keep Hood from *dying*, just rambling on behind the surgical mask.

And after a while, when the Red Hood had finally passed out after refusing painkillers that Nightwing had looked up at him with the lenses raised to those startling blue eyes. He’d already hit the *relieved* stage once Tim reassured him all the organs were back where they *should be* and *no*, the guy’s chances are *much* better than the 24.5% when they first hit his fire escape. Hood would live and probably swing another night.

“Thanks for everything, Tim. I knew if there was *anyone* that could save this cranky asshole, it would be you.”

And the doctor knows the mask over his mouth crinkles when he grins, trying to be as sterile as things like *his kitchen table* could be, and starts on closing up the jagged laceration.

Nightwing was sitting up on the opposite side, watching the final process, ready to jump if<br>

his partner came to swinging (“old instincts,” he’d explained). And the doctor almost dropped the antiseptic after closing up when the older vigilante asked him casually, *calmly* if he felt the need to break free of the *strain* he’d been talking about when he’d been pretty much shoving Hood’s organs back in his body cavity.

He really didn’t *need* to ask what Nightwing was referring to. In their almost year acquaintance in that *haven’t I ****told**** you bullets, knives, and explosives are ****bad**** for your health* kind of way, this isn’t the *first* time N had tried to find out his...um, *preferences*.

(And they say Beast Boy has no shame. Well, *this guy* is right on *that* train.)

“I’m *human*, you know,” he counters, “and everyone has their vices, if that’s what you’re implying, *Big Wing*.”

Nightwing hadn’t commented on the name drop. *Nope*, he grins back instead, propping his cheek on one gloved fist. “Don’t feel awkward about giving out the deets, Timmy. You wouldn’t *believe* the things I’ve come across in this line of work--”

“The Cosplayers in your suit getting it on?” (And there’s *one* of the *many* examples.)

“Among many *others*\--”

“Hood’s stories are better. He really has a way with narration.”

“I like explication sometimes. But, I *know* I’m getting to you now because you’re not deflecting as well as you usually do. Something you want to share with the class, *Doctor Drake*?”

*Damn.*

“Who are you *kidding*, N*?* Deflection is my weapon of choice. Just consider it my version of a cape and cowl since not everyone can rock skintight spandex and Kevlar.” And since he’s *that guy*, he can play it off, keep moving forward, keep working, keep saving lives, keep being utterly *pissed off* at the ones that he *can’t*.

“C’mon, tell me *something*. My life is too pathetically full of crime fighting and a slow, *boring* day job. Let me live vicariously through the next generation.”

“I never should have let you in out of the cold and given you *snacks*, now I’m never going to be rid of you, am I?”

But Nightwing just glides right over that comment. “Your girl, who is a *friend*,” is literal air quotes while he’s careful with the antiseptic, “is a bestie only, no pictures of anyone but her and her cute kid. Your texts and call logs are so pathetic--”

And *nope*, he knows better than to ask *how* Nightwing knows all this, rather he’s more interested in keeping the Red Hood’s stats up and *other* things, like *not* having this convo (with Dick fucking Grayson).

“I’m not with anyone,” he pointedly stares at his watch, two gloved fingers pressing into Hood’s jugular, pulse is strong and evening out, things are looking better. “We’ve already discussed my sad lack of a *real* life, N.”

The vigilante hums, “we’re not necessarily talking about *current*, Tim.”

*Double damn*. *He’s not getting away from it this time.*

“My former...partners,” he pauses, blinks a little, “were usually as driven as I am. Work-oriented, independent, only children, and in high-stress jobs. Hell, *life* is straining to have some kind of control while everything around you is falling to *shit*. That’s the way it goes, Big Wing. Needless to say my previous relationships were a little more than roommates that occasionally fucked.” He cracks his neck, leans up to pop the vertebrae after the last two *gruelling*, adrenaline-filled hours. In a way that truly bespoke of his experience, he crosses his arms over his chest without getting anything more on his t-shirt, arching a brow at the vigilante, “now, is that *all*? I’d really like to have a Netflix evening with some coffee and day-old takeout.”

Those blue eyes get a little darker when Nightwing simply grins back at him, just like the way he *has* up until now (so why is making his heart speed up and his lower abdomen tighten all of a sudden? What *change* happened with that admission?)

“To be honest, what I *really* want to know is what might happen if someone let you give in once and a while.” N leans forward a little, eyes so fucking *blue,* and his voice deeper in his chest. “What would it *do* to you, Timmy?”

At the time, while filling a syringe full of antibiotics, he’d managed not to swallow his tongue (and keep his hips averted), laughed it off, tell Nightwing he was sure they’d never find out (and keeping the images of *what that could possibly mean *right the hell out of his brain pan).

A few months later, and look at where they are *now*.

It had been a gruelling, *heavy* shift, complete with superhero-induced *catastrophe*. Three days and two nights with short, sporadic naps taken on uncomfortable gurneys and tucked back in one of the janitorial closets weren’t really enough to make sure he stays *on his game*. Still, he pushes through the gauntlet in the first eight hours, runs beside bleeders and strokes, jumps and cuts when it’s *go time*, yells and listens at once, gets the numbers and calculates, tries to make a plan for it *all*.

But after the first twelve hours, utter destruction happens at Gotham Stadium. The Justice League took on the Emperors of Evil in their city, and the aftermath is...*horrific*. They need people on the scene, they *needed* as many as they could *get*, and his thought processes could only support *one* setting: *save as many as you fucking can*.

And he climbed with crews all over the debris, digging out survivors in the wreckage where he could, pulling bodies (and even...smaller bodies--*oh God that could almost be Layla*) out, almost crying in relief when things like *alive* might be iffy but *still*.

He stays for hours on-site to deliver as much aid as he can while Steph stays behind at Mercy to coordinate their resources and prepare for the onslaught. He kneels in the grass with blood all over him, straddling a teenager with empty eyes staring up at him and tears running down his face while he gives it one more try with CPR. It’s only *one* out of a hundred, only one hundred out of the *thousands* that were in that stadium when it came down and the Justice League did everything they fucking *could* to get as many people out as fast as possible.

Few things trickled past his already divided attention, but the Justice League calling in pretty much *everyone* from the second and third strings became a *thing* since there’s a super *someone* all over him no matter where he darts off to next. It’s Booster Gold helping him dig through debris at screams below, then it’s Hawkgirl hefting him up to fly across the destroyed foundation to the next patch of survivors, swooping back in again when he’s looking for the next emergency. At some point even Captain Atom shoved a water bottle in his hands and stuffed his bag full of more supplies before he was off. Shazam was on his game, being absurdly careful when a new survivor was put in his arms to carry back to the waiting ambulances.

The only shining light in the constant move and strain, in the aftermath of *oh my God*, is how much faster it went with the superheroes helping out emergency crews--the site cleared of survivors in eight hours rather than *weeks*. In the face of the rows of body bags, it’s a consolation, but still not *enough* and fuck if he could have been faster--

By the time he’s back at Mercy, he’s twitchy and wrung-out, suffering from a form of post-traumatic stress (and all those *thank-yous*, all those *you did its*, all of them were silent next to the still chests and empty eyes).

By the time he was finally relieved, Steph was the only person that could even *tolerate* being near him.

By the time he’s got his windbreaker and ear buds, she’s shooing him out of bay doors weilding a clipboard, not looking very much better, and something in him *gives* so he doesn’t have to be more of a pain in her ass. He’s pretty sure all she wants to do is go pick-up Layla, take her home, and hug the crap out of her.

So, he goes home in a daze, half-nauseous and dizzy. He has immediate plans to close himself off in the saferoom his significant others built to hide their suits and toys, soundproof and hidden, to just fucking *scream*.

The second he opens his front door, he gets an eyeful of them both dressed down in comfortable civvies, standing in his living room, obviously waiting. Something delicious-smelling is cooking in his kitchen and his shoulders are tight enough to rip his scrubs if he even *moves* the wrong way.

“Baby…” is Dick trying to be eternally *gentle* since, well, N and Hood were right with the JLA trying to help the people that got caught when the stadium came down. They even stayed until almost dawn and the clean-up was underway.

He’d been too busy to stop, to see them in their nighttime usual. He had not concept of them *in the world* once he started with triage.

“N-no…” he holds up a hand, wheezes out, stops the two of them from coming forward. And like he has some sort of magic touch, they both freeze in the first step.

His whole body is *tight* enough to snap, but he’s too locked down to move, to *break*, and he stands there, staring at them. He stands with his spine ramrod straight, his hands fisting at his sides.

“I...I *need*,” is wheezed out because of the few times they’ve *done this* for him, it had been on bad nights when he couldn’t even *bend*, nights when he needed them to control *everything*.

Jay’s mouth opens but no sound comes out; he looks torn between moving forward and wrapping him up in those massive arms, or putting him down on the couch to smother him with a longer, more muscled body.

But that isn’t what he *needs*.

And Dick is the one that *gets it*.

“*Kneel*,” is sharp and immediate, using a tone of voice that resonates down his spine, makes his legs give out right then and there to do exactly as he’s told.

(And it feels good, feels *calm* when he reacts fast, when that makes him *good*. It’s what he can focus on, what can take everything else out of his fucking *brain*.)

Jay makes a humming noise when his knees crack on the wood floor, and the two vigilantes exchange a glance while his muscles start to unclench an inch at a time.

“That’s right, Timmy,” Dick steps up slowly, barefoot and graceful, talking firm and soft, “that’s exactly what I wanted.”

A hand slides gently into his hair, threading through, scratches at his scalp in reward, “he’s so good for us, isn’t he Jay?”

The broad, calloused hand is easy fitting under his chin, thumb passing over his bottom lip, and those eyes peer down at him with soft satisfaction, flecks of green lighter in the dim, “he’s just as *sweet* as he can be, Dickie. Ain’t no better fer us, you feel me?”

And a long, deep sigh from somewhere around the vicinity of his toes empties his lungs of sooty air, makes him really stop and *take a fucking breath*.

Even as he’s willingly sinking lower into the haze, in loosening the rigid hold on his every action and re-action, his next step to his last, on maintaining the numbers, calculating what the body in front of him would need to reach the right balance to *survive*.

“We *missed* you so much,” Dick purrs softly. “Welcome home, baby.”

His eyes move sluggishly up, sinking a little lower on his knees, sinking into the floor like it’s sand instead of *water*.

“Made y’ dinner, Sugar. Cleaned up y’ place a ‘lil, made sure ya knew we was *waiting*.”

There might be a whimper, something that makes the tension in his shoulders ease down, makes him lean a little into their hands, listening to the cadence of their voices.

“So you’re going to trust us, aren’t you, baby?” Dick leans down, tilts his head back to stare *up*, and his neck moves loose and easy. “You know the rules we play by when you need to let *go*.”

And *yes*, he *knows*, but--

“Give us the *okay*, Timmy,” Jay pushes a thumb on his chin, opens his mouth just enough to run that thumb along his lower lip. “It’s always yer call ta *submit* er *not*. On how *far* ya wanna take it, on how *much* we can getatcha.” He leans down with Dick, to smile wide and white. “Just say th’ word, Sugar. Tell us whatcha *need.*”

And the trigger for the scene, for when he’s willing to step *back* and try this with them, the rules and boundaries, the fire-faced conversation of kinks in *every* flavor should the scene go *there* (it was more Jay than Dick--totally *mindblown*), is something his vigilante boyfriends found unbearably *hot*.

“Yes...*Sirs*.”

And if there has *ever* been a time when he need to just *not fucking think*, it’s right *now*\--

“So good,” Dick coos a little, scratching right where it makes his eyes fall half-mast, “I *know* that was such a hard call, baby.”

“Yeah, Sugar-Pie, tha’s just what ya needed, ain’t it? S’all right ‘cause Dickie and I are gonna take *care* a’ ya, just like y’ deserve.”

He slowly blinks up at them, sighing easier, lighter, his hands loose at his sides, moving with their hands only.

“I want you to stand up and go in the bathroom with Jay,” Dick leans down further to kiss his forehead, “you’re going to shower and get dressed in the clothes I set out for you. Then you’re going to come back in here and sit at the table. Do you understand all that, Timmy?”

“Yes, Sir,” falls out of his mouth, slightly slurry, looking up at the two vigilantes standing over him, smiling down at him with soft eyes.

He’s in a daze when Jason grips his wrist, squeezes, lifts him to his feet. Dick kisses his forehead again before they go to the big bathroom.

He’s pliant and easy, stops when Jason is the one that washes away the smell of disinfectant and old blood. His sore muscles twitch, go tense and tight at intervals. His hands are a mess of bruises and cuts from the wreckage and debris, from numerous pairs of gloves, from digging in, and Jason washes them gently, clucking his tongue over the scrapes and abrasions. His legs get the same treatment, small cuts and road rash, the back of one shoulder when he fell (and with the Red Hood naked with him in the shower, being so *easy* and firm, telling him when to lift his leg or arm, moving him with those huge hands, dictating what would come first to what would come last, all of it eases down his spine, settles in a warm pool of contentment in his belly).

For long, painful moments after he’s clean, Jay just holds his body weight up, pressing a cheek in Tim’s wet hair while the water gushes over them, starting to get cold.

(And he gets *more* of that *mouth* when Jay strokes a gentle hand down his back, talking against his hair in that rough Gotham tone, “s’all right, Timmy. M’ right here f’ ya. Don’t gotta think ‘bout *nothin’* but me, n’ what I need f’ ya ta do. Jus’ be *good* f’ me.” When Jason’s talking, he can just *be still*, and lay against warm, wet skin.)

The clothes Dick told him to put on are set out on the sink when Jay opens the shower door and leads him out, moves his fumbling hands aside (and how fucked up *is that?* His hands are always steady, always perfectly *precise*) and dries him off with a happy hum under his breath when Tim just lets him do it.

When his focus wavers and the haze lifts slightly, his muscles tense all over again, tremble with the hard pace he’d been at for *days*. He almost moves, almost reaches past Jay for the shirt, stops himself part way when the snap of fingers makes him *stop*. His arm drops back down and the tension eases.

Jason dresses him in old shorts and tank top (*What are things that can be easily removed for $1000?*). But like his body is on auto-pilot, he lifts and maneuvers when told, following the directions without even thinking.

He follows dutifully to sit at the table, the warm feeling in the pit of his belly growing with the pat to the top of his head while a plate is put in front of him.

“Eat,” Dick orders, no-nonsense about it.

He hesitates long enough to give them both a look and the lack of any food in front of them.

“*Timmy*,” since the *now* is implied.

It’s easier than he realizes, doing just that. Getting in the shower because Dick said so, lifting a limb for soap or towel or shirt because Jay wanted him to do it, picking up the fork and putting food in his mouth, chewing, swallowing, and ready for the next bite. Wash, rinse, repeat.

It’s just so *easy* when his brain is overloaded and there’s nothing here that needs his immediate reaction or response. He doesn’t *need* to make plans right now, can just let his significant others dictate the way.

He drinks the full glass of water set in front of him, finishes off the plate without realizing it, just enjoying being fuzzily aware.

There’s a sharp smell, a sting in his left hand, and he blinks at Jay sitting beside him with his vigilante-only doctor’s bag on the table. Alfred’s salve is spread over an abrasion and he twitches slightly at the pain.

“All right, baby,” Dick’s voice jars him out of the calm headspace, makes him blink rapidly and straighten up a little because--

“No, no, Timmy,” Jay’s hand slides into his hair, nails scratching at his scalp, “‘member? Don’t gotta think about *nothing*. Just gonna be a good boy for us tonight, ain’t ya?”

His eyes fall half-mast with the motion again, “yes, Sir,” falls out of his mouth, bubbles up from somewhere deep in his chest.

“That’s exactly what we want,” Dick’s eyes are suddenly in front of him, the older Robin bending down a little so Tim doesn’t have to look up. “Just be *good* for us, baby.”

So he hums a little, waits for the next order, muscle loose and pliant for whatever might be needed, *expected*, demanded.

Dick washes up his plate and utensils while Jay pulls up the chair beside him, pulls him against that broad chest to rest a little while the hand in his hair moves gently, making him sink further and further down.

He barely hears, “okay, Baby Bird, let’s go--” because both of them are gripping him, pulling him up to stand, leading him back down the hallway to his bedroom.

(*Please, please touch me*, *ground me, give me what I ****need***)

“Check in, Timmy,” Dick’s voice cuts across his wandering thoughts.

Jay is bending down to pull the sheets and comforter down, and Dick is already shirtless, looking ready to crawl in bed and hold on to him while he slowly passes out.

He blinks, looks up at those blue, blue eyes, and swallows a little before he puts it *out there*, “Green...Sir.”

He doesn’t need to see Jason to know the vigilante stops, looks up at them at the same time Dick hikes up an eyebrow and a slow smile spreads over his face.

“Oh? I think Baby Bird wants ta *play* before beddy-bye.”

And warmth moves up from his chest to heat his face, makes him glance away.

“Eyes,” Dick immediately orders, taking the option away.

He gasps in a small breath, but follows the command, his face getting even *pinker*.

Jay eases up against his back, hands on his hips, leans down to talk against the side of his throat, “whatcha safe words, baby? Remind me.”

While Dick’s hands slide under his shirt, palms moving over his sides and up, he groans a little on the end of, “red, yellow, green.”

“And you’ll use them if you need to, won’t you, Timmy?”

Jay runs his tongue over the pulse starting to pick up, bite just *slightly*.

“Yes, Sir,” he gasps because he can’t look *away*, has to be, *wants* to be good for them, to give up the intense concentration, the grip on his every *move*.

He wants the freedom *this* can give him.

“That’s exactly what I want to hear.”

And Dick’s eyes shift, move to Jay’s over his shoulder as the slow smile slides over his face again, the calculations, the *plans* moving, taking shape.

Jay cocks a brow up at him, still sucking on Tim’s throat, only pulling off because he needs to know the *deets* on how they’re going to play this with their overworked boyfriend.

“Already gotch it, don’tcha, Baby Boy?”

Dick’s hands pause, thumbs moving in circles just outside the areola of Tim’s nipples, teasing the skin with how *close*.

“I definitely have a good idea on where to start,” is Dick’s reply, eyes slide back down to Tim’s hazy ones.

“I wanna fuck him by the end, yeah?”

“I think he’s going to like what you do, Jaybird, don’t worry. We’re going to push him a little hard tonight, but he needs it.”

The maddening touch makes Tim arch a little while they talk about him, about *this*, about how far they could make him *go*.

“I like the sound ‘a alla that. Fuck, he’s so *pretty* like this, all kinds of loose and sweet. My Sugar-Pie.”

Dick laughs low, “we’ll get there. He’s not ready yet, so he’s going to sit for a while and let us set the scene.”

The noise that comes out would be *mortifying* if he didn’t realize what he was going to *get*.

Both men surrounding him chuckle low, Dick’s eyes crinkling when he lowers his head, giving just a ghost of a kiss.

“All right, baby. You’re going to kneel by the desk for me, and we’re going to restrain you. When we’re done, you’re going to *watch*. Don’t look away, do you understand?”

“*Yes*, *Sir,*” he whimpers out, moving just *slightly*, following Dick’s mouth.

A soft sigh and Dick comes back, giving him fast and hot and *hard*, taking his mouth deep. Watching them, Jay groans against his neck, and those hands bite down on his hips, pull him just an inch or so back, rubs a hard cock right against his ass.

And like they *planned* it together, the two of them pull back, pull *away* from him, and like he’s told, Tim falls to his knees beside his desk, grips one wrist with the other hand behind his back.

(And now he *knows*, Steph called ahead, or Oracle caught him on some camera and ratted him *out*, or *something* because all the supplies they need are already prepared. The pillow by the desk for him to kneel on, the restraints, the long, thin cane right on the desk top. Even more, the sight of the gag in Dick’s hand makes a throb go through him, makes his hips jerk, and they hadn’t even gotten him *ready* yet.)

He’s good when Dick kneels down to slide his shirt off and Jason fits the leather cuffs on his wrists, leaning in to suck at his bottom lip, slide his tongue in Tim’s mouth while he has the *chance*. The D-rings are clipped together at the small of his back, and he moans out, drops his mouth open to accept the cock gag in his mouth to nestle in the back of his throat, to get used to the feel of his mouth being *full* while Dick secures it.

The feel of metal against his bound hand, one of Dick’s escrima sticks, is there for him to hold. While he’s gagged, he grips it tight in both hands, can drop it if he needs to stop.

He gets a kiss to the side of his throat and a palm working against his hard cock through his sweats (“now that? Is *bee-YOU-tiful*, ain’t it, Big Wing?” “He’s so perfect,” is Dick’s sighed response) before the two leave him kneeling there, secured.

Dick moves fast, hands up to cup Jay’s face before he brings them together for the first kiss, stepping into the younger vigilante, to put them together.

Jason moans a little in his mouth, hands slide up the back of Dick’s thighs to grip *that incredible ass* while they eat each other *down*, exchange breath and groans and taste and tongue, give and take, move and slide against one another. They pull apart so Jay can mouth at the planes and scarred skin bare to his lips and teeth and tongue, so Dick can shiver when he sucks a tight nub in his mouth.

Dick leans back with a hard moan, one hand sliding into Jay’s sweats, to give him a small squeeze at the base of his cock, to work him *harder* with the perfect grip and a slow, smooth rhythm. The “*uh!”* makes the younger man watching them bite down on the gag filling his mouth, to squirm where he stays on his knees.

Making their way to his bed, moving sideways so he can have an unobstructed view, Dick manages to wrestle Jay’s shirt off before they’re at one another’s mouth again, hands moving over skin, finding sensitive spots with practiced fingers.

Two of the three of them moan when Dick sinks to his knees, shoving Jay’s sweats down to his thighs and lick a long line right from the base of that hard cock to the tip. And Jason’s knees get *weak* when Dickie takes him all in, makes him gasp, makes him almost lose it, just those hands gripping the back of his thighs to hold him up.

And poor Timmy just suffering in silence, face pink, and mouth so *full*.

He groans out loud when the tongue wrapping around the head of his dick sucked before Big Wing goes back *down*.

“Fuck, oh *fuck*, Baby Boy. Like the taste of my cock, don’tcha? God, y’ always take it so *well*.”

And he so *does*. Because Dick is a *master* and smiles around Jay’s cock before he gets to *work*.

Watching the way Dick takes him in *deep*, Tim is whimpering low in the base of his throat, while his cock gets even *harder* in his sweats, his hands gripping the escrima stick with white knuckles, straining at the leather cuffs holding him still.

“Fuck, *Dick*,” when Jason’s voice goes high, Tim gasps in sharply through his nose, precome wetting the fabric, trying to keep himself from *begging* (please, *please* let him do *something*), not that they’d get the words necessarily, but the *message would be obvi*.

“Don’t wanna come yet, ah, ah, god*damn *yer *mouth*, Baby Boy, all tight n’ *wet*. Perfect hole fer me ta *fuck*.”

But Dick just urges him on, tightens his grip, pulls him in hard to fuck right up against the back of his throat, making Jason yell out, grip his neck *tight*, slide the other hand into his hair, and hold him *still* for it.

Tim’s groans around the gag, unconsciously tonguing it, *sucking* it, as the first few slow, sensual slides makes him *throb*, down to the tremble of Jay’s thighs as he fucks into Dick’s mouth. Still on his knees, he’s unconsciously leaning forward as far as he can and keep his balance, hypnotized when the rhythm speeds up and slows down, by the way Dick takes it with half-mast eyes, sucking when he can, moaning for it. He shoves a hand down his own sweats, his hips undulate when he palms his own cock, working himself.

Jay has gone red down to his chest, head thrown back, and gasping in hard breaths, trying to keep *control*. He pulls Dick off when he gets this side of *too close*, moving one hand to thumb the line of jaw, palm the side of his Baby Boy’s throat.

“You’re so *pretty* on my cock, Dickie. See whatcha doin’ t’ Baby Bird.” Jay turns Dick’s face, makes him to *lookit*.

Their submissive hasn’t looked *away*, hasn’t *moved*, just like he was told. He was *good *for them, so they’re going to--

they *have* to --

he might just *die* if they *don’t*

And even though he wants to just break down and *beg* a little around the girth in his mouth, he knows that isn’t what they told him to do. He knows he’s going to get to come by the time everything is said and done; he knows they’re going to make him feel fan-fucking-*tastic* by the end of the night, and it’s all so *easy* right then, with the two of them looking at him fondly, a picture that would make *anyone’s* panties *soaked* to just look at.

All the muscles and skin and scars, the hands and mouths and snark and *sex*. All of it is *his*, and he can trust them to take care of him.

(*Fuck, it’s terrifying and vindicating in the same breath)*

So he straightens up, leans back a little, and finds it easier to wait, to just *give in*.

“Didn’t we have a *theory*,” Dick drawls out, turn back to give Jay a wide smile, “on whether or not you could make him come just with dirty talk?”

“Mm. I seem ta remember somethin’ ‘bout that. Why not come up here ta me, lemme talk atcha a little *more* then?”

“That is terribly cheesy and exactly why I love you, you goofball.”

“What? Look who’s talking, Dick. Yer jokes are *shit* even if you’re ass is outta this *world*.”

Both men are smiling fondly as Jay pulls him, gets the acrobat flopped down on the bed, gets to kneel between Dick’s legs and watch the *show* of undulating hips and powerful thighs as the sweats come down and off, giving Jay the perfect *sight*.

Since they’re playing a game with Timmy, working him into maybe thinking about if he’d really want to scene with them like this, he grins unabashedly, running his hands up the inside of those *thighs* and starts thinking about his monologue, “lookit ya laying *out* f’ me, Baby Boy. Ain’tcha just the prettiest thing I ever *saw.*” He gives Dick’s balls a tug, fists the base of him and squeezes, “got so *hard* suckin’ me, letting me fuck inta ya sweet *mouth*. Know how much y’ like me in yer throat, tryin’ ta make me *come* f’ ya, give ya a lil’ *reward*.”

“Yes,” Dick gasps, hips thrusting up into Jay’s grip, “fuck *yes*, babe. I *love* when you come down my throat.” He shivers all over when another squeeze makes him clench a fist full of sheets and arches his back hard.

“Not yet, Baby Boy, want something *else*. Wanna letcha open me up, get me nice n’ *wet* f’ ya, get me ready so’s ya can slide deep in me, fill me *up*. Wanna be *Fucked. So. Good, *Dickie. Wanna feel your cock in me alla way.”

In his hand, Dick’s cock gives a spurt of precome, the acrobat writhing under him, “dammit, you’re such a *tease*.”

Jay just laughs, walks on his knees until he can slide his cock against Dick’s palm. “I wanna come with yer cock in me, Baby Boy. Wantcha ta fuck me *deep* and hard, make me *scream* f’ ya.”

And just like they *want*, Tim’s hips thrust helplessly, watching Jay thrust his cock against Dick’s, against his hand, working them both so perfectly, listening to every detail while his tortured length throbs in the constraints of his pants, while he strains to touch and take. The gag muffles his helpless moans and all he can *do* is pants through his nose trying to breathe. Dick makes none of his suffering any *better*, thrusting up off the bed against the hold around his cock, moaning out from deep in his chest.

“You’re always so *tight* around me, Little Wing, gets me fucking hard just thinking about the noises you make when I slide right in--”

“Ya like it when I ride ya, baby, when I bounce on yer cock just *right*.”

Dick groans out and decides to start with Phase II.

He gets a palm on Jay’s hip, plants a foot, and tosses them over, fast and agile, slides himself right between Jay’s legs so he can give his very tolerant boyfriend exactly what he *asked* for. Jay scrambles in the sheets, finds the lube, and spreads his thighs to accommodate Dick’s hips. It’s the sweet slide of skin against skin, of licking and sucking at one another’s mouth while the cap pops, and wet fingers circle his entrance, making him moan in Dick’s mouth at the fucking anticipation, the *want*.

He moves one leg around Dick’s hips, sliding a hand down the curve of spine, and works against the fingers, making sure to move his other leg so Timmy can get the full *show*.

But he gets *distracted*, see? Because Dickie’s hands are fucking *magic* and fingers work into him, easy and wet, giving him some ‘a what he *craves*. He groans, pulling Dick up to open for him again, sliding his tongue against his Baby Boy’s while his body heats up for it, to feel Dickie sliding in him, taking him slow n’ easy at first, speedin’ it up when the both of them are at their wit’s *end*.

“C’mon, Dick, *c’mon*,” he grunts out, takes the lunge back down to the bed when Dick fucks his tongue back in, and the fingers in him slide a little *deeper* on the next few strokes--

Jay’s legs twitch with it, his hips jolting.

“*There* it is,” Dick laughs, moving to breathe over his throat, groans while he gets the sharp *bite*.

With the next jolt, Jay arches, throwing his head back at the arcs of *oh fuck, yeah* hitting him all over. He manages to slither a hand down and palm the acrobat’s hard cock working against his own, another high noise trapped in his throat.

And the two of them undulate against one another, casting subtle glances to their doctor still kneeling, eyes half-mast. He’s red down to his chest, the front of his pants wet from how *hard* they making him--

But he’s being so *good* for them, not looking away, staying upright with his back straight and seeming more calm, so *perfectly* at ease.

Dick adds a third finger, moaning out at the hand stroking his cock while he licks and sucks at the tight nubs on Jay’s chest, makes his hand stutter.

It’s just one of those little things when Jay finally starts letting *go*, lays out pliant and open, giving himself up (*and it’s been a long row for them before they ever met Timmy, before Jay came back to visit the Manor, before he was s’all right with B, before he could even *tolerate* being near Big Wing again. Well, fuck, the Demon was the one he started hanging out with *first* any damn way*).

“*Baby Boy. *Oohh...oh, uuhh, yeah. Ah, ah, aahhh, y’ know how fucking *good* that shit feels,” and his thighs get tight around Dick’s hips, move so he can rock on those fingers, find his *spot* himself, give Timmy a *show* while Dick licks him, moves back to his mouth again.

“I *do*, Jaybird,” the asshole purrs, his usual smug and sadistic, “I love seeing your *face* when I get you *right here*,” Dick slides a forearms under his crime fighting partner, lifts his hips just enough for fingers to go *deeper*, *harder*, make Jay twist and cry out with it.

When Jay arches more, when those thighs clamp *down*, and it’s such a fucking *beautiful* arch of scarred skin and sinews, Tim whimpers at the very sight, arches his own back to give his throbbing cock just a *little* friction against the wet fabric of his boxers and the weight of the sweatpants. He tries to stop the noises in his chest, doesn’t want to do anything to disturb the scene going on in front of him, but his knees and thighs are trembling a little with how *close* his orgasm is right now, how he’s clenching *tight* because he fucking *wants* to be filled just as badly.

He watches Dick’s mouth drop open because Jay’s hand squeezes the base of his cock when his spot is worked, when the Red Hood is riding the waves of pleasure taking him over.

“Oh *God*, baby,” Dick draws out, speeding up a little, casting half-mast eyes over to their suffering third, “he’s so ready for me, Timmy. He’s so tight and wet now.”

Tim’s eyes slide up and back down, biting on the gag, panting through his nose.

“Do you want to see me fuck inside him, baby? Want me to make him come on my cock?” Dick can’t help but chuckle low when their boyfriend moans and leans closer to them, his face hot and panting through his nose, jaw working as much as it can, chewing on the gag in his mouth. His grin only gets dirtier when he gives the *coup de’ gras*, “I’ll tell you what, baby. If you don’t come until I *tell you to*, then you can open me up.”

The sigh huffed out gives the right message: *that’s it? I’m being so *good* here*.

“*And,*” Dick pushes in again, making Jason jolt in his grip, “you can use the Nightwing gloves to do it.”

The high noise is trapped because *what the ****fuck****?* Tim leans over a little, desperately trying to think about gross, terrible *things* to keep his cock from exploding (because he very, *very* much would like to do that. Yes, yes *please* fucking *give him this*). But *really*, it absolutely is *just like Dick* to say he can’t come and give him the exact *opposite* of that goal.

(Both of them are terrible, terrible teases, right up to the point of *sadists*...and he wouldn’t have them any other way.)

At the same time, Jason has to reach down and grip Big Wing’s wrist to stop the thrusts so he can *laugh* like a bastard.

“Seriously, Dick?”

The older vigilante just shrugs and lowers Jay’s hips, gripping stead to pull him closer, to set that *ass* right in his lap, rubbing his cock against the opening, “we all have our kinks, you know.” His thumbs absently circles the rim, and Jason shudders against his thighs.

“Yer gonna make ‘im *cry*,” and a long breath out when he feels the head of Dick’s cock playing at his entrance, wraps his legs around Dick’s hips, and reaches to palm himself, “if y’ don’t let ‘im do *somethin’* soon.”

“Then I guess,” and without a pause, Dick pushes in, a firm, slow, slick slide to sheath himself *deep*; he groans with it, eyes falling half-mast while Jay grips his thigh, his chest rumbling with the low whine.

“I’ll have to take care of *you* then our Baby Bird, right *Jason*?”

But the younger vigilante is panting out, gripping and holding while he feel so goddamned *full*. It had been a while since he bottomed, and *fuck* did he miss how *good* it could be.

“Oh...oh *fuck*, Jay,” Dick gasps in, eyes falling shut, fingers tightening (the bruises are going to be *beautiful* later).
