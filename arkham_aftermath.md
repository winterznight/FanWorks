## Dr!Tim: Arkham Aftermath

The hard part about being a boyfriend to incredibly capable vigilantes is that sometimes, they get a little...over-protective.

(*Reads as: stifling.*)

And, most times, it’s really not an issue because Dr. Drake is pretty good at taking potentially dangerous fuckery in stride. He’s a Trauma Surgeon because he doesn’t crack under pressure, because he can see the absolute most *awful* things and still keep moving with the intent that someone has to save lives. He’s too stubborn to let atrocity stop him from fighting the good fight.

(*Well, also because he takes care of vigilantes and superheroes, and he’s got to be on his game in front of the Justice League or he’ll never live down the shame. His fanboy membership card could be revoked. *Forever.*.*)

So generally, he can shake Dick and Jay out of *intense coddling *by laughing off the most recent crisis and just focus on moving forward, getting back to what, in their lives, can be considered *normal*.

The last bout at Arkham when half the Rogue Gallery stood against him, inmates ready to take him out permanently, no police, no helpful vigilantes in sight, admittedly shook him more than anything he’s been through up until now.

(*The Joker *knows* him on sight. Knows his ****name****.*)

He wasn’t completely over it when the Fear Gas incident hit a little closer to home. And even if he spent a week buried in Wayne Manor with the entirety of the Bat family around him, being coddled as fuck by scary vigilantes–

(*that’s right. Even Dami was hesitant to let Tim go back to work after all of that.*)

– convincing himself he was *fine* was harder this time around.

So maybe...maybe he didn’t fight off Dick and Jay’s overly attentive mother-henning as much as he has in the past when it was that little fiasco on the bridge. Maybe he was fine when they checked on him half-way through their patrol, actually waited for one of them to pick him up instead of just walking home from Steph’s for babysitting duty or Ives’ gaming night, was okay being overly cuddled when nightmares drove him up out of a dead sleep.

His boyfriends unfortunately picked up on this before he did, how he isn’t bouncing back as fast as he normally does, how he gives into their paranoia instead of fighting against them for every inch of freedom back.

Dick and Jason talk about it on patrol and sometimes when Tim’s passed out in bed with them, curled into a protective ball with both arms wrapped around himself.

Their automatic reaction is to be gentle with him for a while, to be *sweet*. They watch for signs he’s sliding back into the trauma, make sure he talks it out as much as he needs to, give him the distraction he needs when they haltingly talk about their own traumas in and out of the masks, give him pieces of themselves when he feels like he’s wavering.

(*Fuck does he love them*.)

A few weeks after the incident at Arkham Asylum when the concussion and bruised ribs, the road rash with associated cuts and contusions seem to be healed as well as possible, Dick has to leave for some potential world-ending fuckery and calls together the team in Titan’s Tower to do what they do best.

It’s fine really because Jay, Dami, B, and Cass patrol in Gotham, so Jay’s there sometimes when the nightmares of Two-Face gleefully gunning him down are fucking *awful*, but much more manageable with a broad back or chest to huddle against while the terror winds down.

A few days after Dick’s been gone, and he goes back to the hospital to take a few twelve-hour shifts since, you know, being slightly traumatized is finally *boring as fuck*.

As he’s had to do most of his life, he picks himself up, dusts himself off, and keeps moving forward. He’s got people that need him, and fuck if that isn’t a jarring realization.

So when he’s finally done cowering, remembers this is, well, *Gotham*, he kisses his sleeping vigilante gently before leaving, and closes the door softly behind him.

Working the Gauntlet is better for his state of mind than binge watching Netflix, so he survives the night without Steph, keeps moving from one diagnosis, one procedure, one emergency to the next, keeps his brain at the top of the game. Adrenaline replaces the clenching in his stomach and it does feel good doing his part in the fight to save the city.

It feels *good* to be moving, to be doing something right, and he gives no shits about taking a break to go up to the roof where the Red Hood is waiting for an update.

(*It’s better when the helmet comes off for deep, hot kisses. It’s much, *much* better when Jay’s big body, armored chest, gloved hands, leathery feel of the domino against his nose, when all of it invades his senses.*)

His boyfriend purposefully checks him all over before letting him go back down to the ER, still seemingly not satisfied he’s ready for duty again.

“Gonna be back ta getcha, Timmy, so’s ya better wait on me.” Followed by one more deep, long kiss before Jay puts the helmet back on and shoots a grapple into the night.

Dick annoyingly tries to Facetime him several times through the shift, and probably already has the live feed rolling on one of his screens in the Tower while he’s working with his team to make all sorts of *plans*.

Color Tim surprised when he finally answers the call on a break, slurping down God-awful coffee to keep himself moving, and Nightwing’s stern face along is surrounded by the Titans crowding into the screen.

“He doesn’t look too bad,” is Wonder Girl tilting her head to stare at his image.

“Hey Doc!” Kid Flash is grinning wide, hand blurring because of speed and video quality.

“Nightwing said you were in the middle of an Arkham attack,” Superboy pointedly talks loudly to shut everyone else up, “we heard you were up against like, a *bunch* of the Rogue Gallery of Evil Asshats. But man, did they really hold you hostage?!”

“Ah, well. That...sounds pretty accurate,” he hedges, leaning back against the row of lockers, subtle glances around to make sure he’s alone. “But I got out okay obviously.”

“The ambulance you were in flipped *over*,” Nightwing growls through the throng of younger superheroes. “You had a concussion, bruised ribs, strained tendons in your knee–”

At the list, the superheroes around him are getting more and more antsy.

(And *nope*, he doesn’t see Superboy and Kid Flash leaning down to talk quietly out of the camera’s view...but if Bart Allen and Conner Kent show up at his penthouse to *hang out*, he’s not going to be too shocked.)

“All of which are much better, thank-you, Nightwing.”

“And then, like, you happened to stumble on some Fear Toxin because *why not?*” Wonder Girl shakes her head. “It’s a good thing you’ve got this guy to watch your ass, Doc. I think you’ve got the worst luck in the worst city on Earth.”

He shrugs a little helplessly because, welp, what can he do?

“Luck has nothing to do with it,” he tries, “I think everyone in Gothams has been gassed at least once. It just happened to be my turn or something.”

“Doc,” and that’s Superboy back in the frame, “don’t you think you should take another few days off? I mean, we’ll have N back to you by then, right?”

Tim bristles a little. He’s been keeping his own ass out of the sling for a hell of a long time before he found said vigilante –

Wait for it

– bleeding out on his *fucking fire escape*.

He can handle himself just fine.

“It’s okay,” he waves off the concern after a second of sipping on the awful coffee. “The hospital is only a couple blocks away. I mean, I can’t get into too much trouble, right?”

How Nightwing can make the whiteout lenses narrow is his *real* superpower.

“My *dude*,” Beast Boy shakes a finger at the screen, “do you even *know* how cranky he is since you’re not at home resting?”

As much as it’s...*endearing*, it’s also slightly irritating, gnawing at him. He might not be a vigilante or a Meta-human or a magic-wielder, but *dammit*, he’s been through bad shit and come back stronger more than once in his life. He didn’t shrink back when his parents died or when those foster families brought him back or beat the shit out of him. He didn’t falter when Tony Stark told him he was “*utterly fucking useless*” his first day at Stark Medical. He didn’t stop moving because life is hard and bad things happen to good people.

And he’s not going to let the last month of terrifying struggle against evil bad guys be the thing that finally breaks him.

That’s when the idea really sparks. What they all needed to move forward.

After living with Jay and Dick for this long, getting used to their usual *tendencies*–

(*like calling up your civilian boyfriend on his regular-guy cell phone with many superheroes hanging out in the foreground*)

–he thinks it might be time to get a little…*proactive*.

“It’s fine. I’m only working half shifts for a while, and Hood is coming to pick me up in the morning, okay? Besides, don’t you all have to prepare to squash terrible bad guys at some point?”

He spends the rest of his shift taking every opportunity to work out a plan, discard parts as necessary, and keep musing on how he’s going to shake them all out of the pall that seemed to have perma-settle after the fear gas incident.

True to form, Jason Todd is standing outside the back of the hospital, out of the way of the ambulance bay by the time Tim comes out in a hoodie and rumpled scrubs. He gives absolutely *no shits* about the other people walking out to be on their way home when he pulls Timmy in tight. Gives another one of those deeply profound kisses. Jay’s hand on the back of his neck firms, keeping him close, warming him up.

He’s a little dazed when Jay finally pulls back, and something is making the green flecks in his eyes get darker than the blue.

“Hey,” Tim carefully raises a hand to palm the side of Jay’s face, staring up into those eyes, wondering if his significant other had a bad night on patrol, “Hey, I’m here. You okay?”

Jay is uncharacteristically quiet, just wraps a hand around Tim’s wrist, holds the hand against his face.

“Jay? Talk to me, honey,” as that big body hunching to loom over him.

It takes a moment. A muscle in Jay’s jaw jumps and his eyes get hazy green for a second before he takes in a deep breath.

And even if the hold is a little too tight to be really comfortable, Tim gets up on his tiptoes to wrap both arms around Jay’s neck and hold back firmly. The kiss to the top of his head is sweet when Jay is ready to finally pull back and thread their fingers together to lead him to the Ducati sitting innocently by the curb.

They don’t talk about it when Jay puts the helmet on him and adjusts the strap under his chin, climbs on infront of him and starts the engine.

They don’t talk about it when clothes come off for a shower to remove the scent of the hospital and the nightly patrol.

They don’t talk about it while Jay gently washes him, big hands moving over his skin without the spice of arousal to heat their blood. It’s too gentle, the look in his eyes, too calm for sex tonight.

They don’t talk about it when Jay holds up the blankets for Tim to climb in and the big body scoots in behind him, thick arm around his waist, and a knee worms between his. Kisses to the back of his neck don’t answer his silent questions, the hand making gentle circles over his belly or hip don’t either.

It’s like that the next few days, Dick being oddly in communication during a case and Jay being creepily more attentive than usual. Even Robin swings by whenever he’s on patrol.

At this juncture in dating the two of them, Tim is grateful for *protect civilian boyfriend* mode, but sometimes they all need something...*something* to snap themselves back to the usual daily/nightly life.

So, he takes the chance to check the back of their closet, look for the things he needs. He absolutely has a *plan*.

\*\*

Ironically, Dami manages to get in on it.

The sound of air whooshing through the phone tells him what Rob is up to tonight.

“I do not understand why you are asking for this,” the voice over the line is darker, deeper than Dami’s normal. It’s the Demon in *Robin *mode.

“I...can’t really explain why,” Tim hesitates, wondering if he’s made a tactical error in calling up the other kick ass vigilante he knows. “I just...need stuff.”

The hum over the line is almost lost when the *bang* of a grapple makes Tim flinch back, almost dropping his phone in soapy water.

He’s already home from his shorter shift, had fed Jason before the Red Hood put on his guns and gauntlets, gave him a kiss before the helmet went on, promised to use the comm if he leaves the Penthouse before Jason was done with patrol.

“This sounds more complicated than you are letting on,” Robin replies after a moment when Tim manages to keep the phone between his shoulder and ear.

“It’s not. Wouldn’t it be a good idea if I had a-a grapple gun? And, you know, knockout pellets?”

The line mutes abruptly, and Tim realizes why when the soft noise of his window opening makes him turn from the sink with sudsy hands.

Robin is through the window quickly even though he’s getting closer and closer to outgrowing Tim by the day.

Rob taps the comm to a different channel, “O. I am taking a short respite. Alert me if you have anything,” before pulling the device out of his ear.

Welp. Should have expected this, shouldn’t he? Drying his hands, he pours the youngest vigilante a cup of coffee, watches the gloves and gauntlets come off, the whiteouts slide up to reveal green eyes. Dami drinks the sludge like his life depends on it, nudging the empty mug with his fingers in the universal *more please*.

Tim brings the pot, pulls out the chair across from the kid and plunks his ass down.

“All right, you got me,” he sighs because *honestly*, family of detectives. He can only get away with so much bullshit before one of them clocks him on it.

“I believed so,” Robin answers evenly in a less dark and scary tone.

“Well, believe me when I say you don’t really want to know *why* I’m asking for stuff.”

An eyebrow arches delicately, “I am certain it has something to do with my brothers and how they have been ridiculously overprotective the last few weeks.”

Tim looks away, already feeling his face start to heat up. “I mean, you’re not...*wrong*.”

“So, you intend to go around armed with a grapple and pellets to what? Assure them you have weapons and a means of escape if any of our Rogue Gallery come for you?...*Again*.”

Since it’s more curiosity than an honest question, Tim lays his head down on the table to try maintaining some of his bullshit tech at this stage. “It’s not about… I just need it for *one night*. I’m not carrying crazy vigilante weaponry in my scrubs, Baby Bat.”

Where he can’t see, Rob pauses in chugging the coffee. The young detective’s mind puts together some pieces as to why their Doctor would ask for such things when he could easily have asked Richard or Jason.

“You do not want them to know you are requesting these things?” Because now Rob is *invested*. “I will not tell them as long as your reasoning won’t amount to causing you further damage.”

And just *how* is he going to explain this to Dami?

“I can’t...promise that? But I can tell you they will be with or close to me for this one-time use.”

Blinking behind the domino, “which of our villains are you planning to fight, Drake?”

“Not...not villains per *say*–”

“From all the provided information, it can be no other.”

Now his face is *flaming*. Dammit.

“Dami, I really don’t want to tell you this.” He groans into one hand.

“If it is not a plan to fight a villain, then you have made an enemy in the hero community? One of our allies perhaps?”

“Nothing at all like that. I’m not fighting anyone except–” and then he clams up because the only people he’s going to fight is Dick and Jay.

And fight is really not the word he would use here.

Rob makes a humming noise, arms crossed over his chest, seeming to think about it. He finally sticks up a hand, palm out. “Before I provide what you have requested, I will need three nights of your time. I will come to your window. Dress appropriately and be ready when I arrive.”

Tim’s mouth drops open, “wait. What now?”

“You heard me,” a final toss and the second cup of coffee is *gone*. Rob is already fitting his gloves and gauntlets back on, standing with further explanation not forthcoming. He’s already turning toward the window, boot up on the sill, “be ready tomorrow night, Drake.”

“But *why?* You have extra–”

“You will come as I have said, or you can ask my brothers. Which shall it be, Timothy?”

He sighs and just *Bats* okay? “All right. I’ll be ready, just *don’t* tell them about this. Keep it on the downlow or you’ll ruin the plan, okay?”

“Understood,” Robin lifts a two-fingered salute and leaps out the window, a smirk cutting across his face.

Tim closes the window and wonders what the hell Dami needs three days for.

\*\*

Shame on him because Baby Bat is taking all this and running with it.

Dressed *appropriately* for night flying through Gotham, Tim looks at every bolt hole and carefully constructed drain pipe Rob points out to him.

“Third window down, fourth across. That is a safe house only we know about. If you get penned down, you can pull a lockpick from under the mortar and get in.”

“I’m not planning on getting caught by insane bad guys with guns and chemical weapons, I *swear*,” he calls over the wind, the comm in his ear staticy with other reports.

Rob finally lands them on the roof of Gotham Savings and Loan, pulls Tim in the overhang of another building to keep them in the shadows.

“Honestly, Drake. I am a *detective*. I know villains and criminals are not the reason you asked for non-fatal, non-offensive weaponry.”

Tim blinks at him, face mostly concealed with his hood pulled up and one of Jason’s red dominoes over his eyes, a pair of Dicks’ gloves over his hands.

(One word. *Fingerstripes*.)

Rob leans in just a little, “if you plan on leading them through Gotham for your role play purposes, *in my name no less*, then you should at least know enough to make them work for it.”

And right there. All the blood in his body goes *right to his face*.

“I mean...it’s not like you’re *wrong* but…”

And this? Is his life. Seriously. Amaze-balls and world-ending embarrassment all in one go.

Rob shrugs a shoulder, “Drake. I am almost seventeen. I do not need details on your intimate relations or about the kink negotiations you have with my *brothers*.” Rob just waves a hand at him. “Needless to say, both of them were...calmer after the last time I allowed you to run Gotham in the tunic. Therefore, I shall allow it again as long as civilians do not see you, and you do *not*, for any reason, attempt to take on real criminals. If another Robin is reported running around, I could lose my foothold with some of my informants. Thus, I am showing you this route *for a reason*.”

He feels like this is the time to facepalm to *Mars*.

Robin, however, who is grinning to himself like a little shit, is openly laughing at him. “As much as they annoy me, I would have to be blind not to know my brothers’...appeal.”

“Please, no,” he moans, “you are not talking about our kinky sex games. Just. No. Doesn’t Batman teach you things?”

Robin’s brow goes up, Tim can tell even with the domino. “About this? No, for which, I am truly, truly grateful. Richard and Jason, however…”

“No. *Nope*. This is a thing I do not know.” He plugs both fingers in his ear for emphasis, eyes narrowing behind the borrowed domino he’d put on for tonight.

Robin shrugs carelessly again, arms crossed over his chest.

Tim just sighs and adjusts his vigilante-only bag over the bone of his shoulder and looks around, “welp, now that we’ve had *that* awkward moment. Where am I?”

“An out-of-the-way building I own,” and like he’s finally deciding to stop being a shit about it, Rob leads him over to a door down into the top floor. “It is a space away from the Manor for training.”

And *what is this about?*

He pauses on the staircase on the way down, the hairs in his eyebrows pulling against the glue of the domino.

“Is this one of those initiation things where you make me eat bowls of Jell-O and then kick my ass or something?”

“Tt. You want knockout and exploding *pellets*. Do you honestly think I will hand them over if you have never used them before?”

Rob doesn’t stop walking or turn around, shaking his head at Drake’s foolishness. How else would his brothers have a Robin suit made if not with his help?

After over an hour of running, ducking, and tossing pellets at targets on Dami’s main floor, he relaxes a little with the weaponized sphere, glad his luck is *on point,* kind of like the first time they did this little Cops and Robbers dance.

Next is how to efficiently use a grapple, where to fire, how to make sure the hook is secure, how long it takes to reel the line. He has a few terrifying free falls from the upper floor, yelp caught in his throat until Rob catches him.

\*\*

The third night is full of surprises because Rob has a package for him, and it’s a *glorious* red, gold, and green.

It’s a play on the one they’d gifted him last time, but this one is more authentic. The armor is stronger, the material heavier, the utility belt stocked full. The boots have heavier soles, the gloves thinner material with abraded fingertips for grabbing. Even the domino looks shinier in the lights from his kitchen.

Demon is drinking coffee and eating a massive amount of his Wheat Thins and hummus, looking pleased with his efforts.

“No one suspected I was making it. Even Pennyworth,” the kid side smirks.

“This is *awesome*,” he breathes out, spreading the pieces out on the kitchen table.

“I am aware.”

“Dami, *thank-you *for this.”

But the waving hand at him isn’t without a bit of pink under Rob’s domino. “Go suit up. You need at least a practice run before you’re ready to take on Todd and Grayson. We’ll run the route again before they are done with patrol.”

Because this couldn’t possibly get *any more awesome.*

And there he is, firing a grapple for real with the authentic Robin beside him, ready to catch him if he loses his grip.

All-in-all, it’s a top ten night in Gotham.

\*\*

The plan is really one of his best ever. He has to give himself a pat on the back.

He works a double and passes the fuck out for five hours, has two days off coming his way. Score. Dick came back this morning from, you know, *space*, and is in the Bat Cave’s decontam until evening.

Likewise, Jay is getting some detecting work done during daylight hours so if he’s lucky, the three of them can have some time off together. He’s sure his significant others pictured a nice date night in a swanky restaurant and club where they can be regular humans and unwind a bit, or maybe a night in watching Netflix and making dinner so his Penthouse smells like Alfred’s kitchen, probably with a communal bath and hot session in bed to round out the night for them.

Welp. Too bad.

He has other *plans*.

After he’s up and moving while Jason is still out and Dick has another hour or so before he’s on his way back to them, Dr. Drake gets a fast shower, preps, and changes into the special two-piece suit.

He saves the armored tunic for after he’s done with the rest of the preparations.

In the hidden niche of their closet, he finds the Renegade suit, pulls a Red Hood special from the back, lays them out in a very pointed *here you go*.

(Just to be safe, he doesn’t check their suits too closely, doesn’t want to accidentally shock the shit out of himself or set off any specialized weapons. It would be his luck he’d electrocute himself and give away the surprise he’s painstakingly prepared for.)

He scribbles a note with a shaky hand and pulls a sharp shuriken *R* from the utility belt, sticks it in the bedroom door while pretty much hopping from one foot to another in *anticipation*.

He unabashedly chugs two cups of coffee and a bottle of water, watching the clock closely. Gloves, socks, boots. Tunic on just like Dami showed him, utility belt above his hip bones, and cape. The *coup de gras* is the domino covering his eyes. The whiteouts slide up as the sun sinks below the horizon and day turns into night.

The window in the bedroom is up and the heavier weight in the soles of the boots helps him make a solid stance to take the slight kick back when the grapple fires and sinks home. He takes a *breath* and smiles like a mad man when he makes the solitary leap.

\*\*

Dick has no qualms palming Jay’s ass while they vigorously make out in the elevator, pulling him further *in*, groaning in his mouth, arching into Little Wing’s touch like he’s *starving*.

Knee shoved between his thighs and they are *both* on board this train apparently.

The elevator gives a cheerful *bing* and they reluctantly pull away, Jason snatches his hand, pulls him out and down the hall to the only door on this floor. The one to their penthouse.

More fumbling because Dick’s arms around him, slick bastard mouthing at his ear is just *fucking askin’ *fer trouble, yeah?

Dammit, he’s just a man. Gotch his own weaknesses, n’ Dickie likes ta exploit the fuck outta ‘em *all*.

Throwing the door open, he drags Dick inside, bellows out for Timmy, and takes precious few seconds to suck on Dick’s tongue. They stumble down the hall toward the bedroom and alla it’s so fucking *good*.

But they both pause when a glint in the light takes ‘em by surprise.

A note stuck ta the door.

*Found you.*

With a fancy looking *R* at the bottom, and *no*, it ain’t Dami’s handwriting.

At all.

Slowly, he and Dick look at one another, bruised lips and bodies thrumming with pent-up energy and adrenaline and *ust*.

Dick gingerly puts a hand under the note, pushes open the door.

No Tim.

Just some very familiar suits and sundries on their bed and –

– an open window.

“Is this what I think it is?” Dick asks low, already reaching out for his Renegade wear.

All the blood in Jason’s body goes immediately to his already half-hard cock because *motherfucking right*.

“Looks like n’ invite ta *play*, Big Wing,” and even to his own ears his voice is low and husky with want.

Clothes are thrown all over the place with a much different *intent* than before. The *slip, slop, click, clock* is magazines slapped in .45s and belts going on, gauntlets clicking in place, boots lacing up. And when they peek out the open window, dominoes on with whiteouts up, the vigilante across the way, perched on a rooftop, turned in a very *come hither* kind of way.

His back and ass curved in Robin red, he fires the grapple and grins just before he launches into the sky.

Almost *salivating*, the two villains are instantly zeroed in on the *chase* and lurch out the window after him.

\*\*

It’s really saying something when Robin looks fine as fuck tonight.

He’s in top form, got a different suit, got more toys, got more skill than the last time they ran him down in Gotham.

Hood and Renegade are in it to win it. Legs burn, adrenaline pumps, arms tighten with each swing, not a pause, not a breath of hesitation as they track the vigilante keeping a few steps ahead of them, obviously leading them on a nice chase through the old part of Midtown.

They haven’t had any witty banter yet because from the moment they gave in, he’s been running like his life depends on it, throwing himself off buildings like he’s utterly fearless, firing at the right time to keep him from being road pizza, his balance over rickety rooftops on fucking *point*.

He kicks off one of the usual gargoyles like he’s done it for years, and both villains have to take a second to catch their breath at how powerful he is in that moment.

“Fuckin’ jock is killing me,” Hood groans over their private channel, looks over at Renengade keeping up with his pace, the flare of yellow and black cape fluttering in eyesight.

“Haha, shouldn’t have bothered with it,” the grin isn’t missed, Hood chuffs through the synths. “We all know how this is going to end anyway.”

White teeth against the mask tells Hood all he needs to know about what Dickie's thinking. Their Little Bird is gonna get what he's got *coming*.

It doesn't take long to hit the dredges of what used to be the industrial side, hollowed out factories being repurposed into open shops and office spaces.

There's less cameras here than there shoulda oughta been, but O's been *busy*, and the Bat patrols here when he's ready for a cool down in his night.

All-in-all, Timmy had some *help* ta get 'em out this far on his own. Keeping one step ahead ain't that much of a stretch, but the last time they played, he was too eager ta get *caught*, yeah? This time, it’s something *more*.

The perfect opportunity hits just as they get him in eye sight again, watch the arch of his back when he reaches the top of the swing, tucks his knees, and somersaults while the line reels back in.

The landing is a thing of *beauty*, cape flaring enough for them to catch a hint of that ass before he's turning to face the oncoming "villains" from around the cloudy skylight.

"Well, well. Lookey what we gots *here*," the second they touchdown, only a few feet away on the other side of the skylight, the guts of the warehouse in shadows and shades of gray. “Didn’t think we’d be seein’ ya again sa soon, *Robin. *Not after we taughtcha one helluva lesson last time.”

"Seems like some people don't learn very well, Hood," and *damn*, it does things ta him when Dickie gets all up in the role.

"Crying fuckin' shame, ain't it?" He intentionally fingers the .45s, gloved fingers sliding across the hilts when his jacket flips back. "Out alone again. Don'tcha know what happens ta little birdies what fly ‘n Gotham at night?"

He and Dickie are slowly stepping closer, watching every move, intendin' ta surround n’ conquer. It's fuckin' awful how he and Dickie are pulling the same thug moves they'd both seen an’ fought again countless times over the years, know they’re givin’ Rob plenty a’ openings to draw out the *game*. Ways he could duck and dart passed them. Ways he could use whatever new toys he's got in that bigger belt.

The anticipation makes him lick over his front teeth.

"Aw, sounds like you missed me," Robin only backs up a step, the whiteouts down but his head slightly adjusts to keep both of them in sight, giving himself away. "But really, an abandoned warehouse? Who *isn't* going to think something is going on?"

"It's too far out to draw attention," Renegade banters back (because really, Dickie just can't help himself), muscles loose, waiting for the right time. "Seems like some people are just too smart for their own good."

"Drugs and weapons aren't that hard to find if you know what you're looking for," Robin takes another step back, making it look like he's going for the door leading down into the building. He'll only have seconds until Renegade and Hood are around the skylight coming for him, so he has to be ready.

He subtly palms pellets, heart pounding, rebreather secured. "But, you made it pretty easy on me last time, right? Maybe we could... come to a similar understanding?"

And just because he's a *nasty bastard*, the Red Hood drops his helmet so he can smirk in the night. "Ya think we're gonna go *easy* on ya this time, Rob? After alla the trouble ya made with this deal, the *money* we lost? Pissed off some powerful people in Gotham t'night, little bird, an' someone --" he cracks his knuckles for effect, "gotta pay the *price*. You feel me here?"

Renegade picks it up for him, drawing Rob's attention away, "we call up the families and tell them we have a Bat, it could go easier for us."

Timmy's hand twitches, and they both catch it. (And the tension their boy has been carrying for mother fucking *weeks* since he made it out alive from a breakout at the Asylum, the haunted look in his eyes, the slouch of his shoulder since he was doused with fear gas, all the effects him and Dickie couldn't take the fuck *away*, not with all the countering bruises from sharp kisses and tight holds. Alla that finally seems to ease down when Robin smirks, apparently thinkin' he's got some kinda edge.)

"Or," Robin counters and straightens up, head tilted to look more at Renegade creeping within arm's length than Hood a few more paces back, "you can let me gather the evidence I need from your nice warehouse and cooperate so I don't have to get serious. If you're lucky, you'll only get 5-to10 in Blackgate instead of 20-to-life."

"Think that's gonna happen, do ya?"

"I also think," he continues louder, "I might want to get off before I bust your operation and leave you for the GCPD. So, I’ll give you *one* chance. Give up."

And he absolutely *means it*. He catches Renegade leading with his good knee, shoulders and back tensed to spring. Hood hangs back to catch any flails for a full pin, takes away his escape, his *options*.

Isn’t this unfortunate. Well, not really because the second they lunge, it’s over. All he has to do is wait them out. Robin keeps his hands from twitching, tightening, giving himself away. Renegade chuckles and *fuck* it raises the hair on the back of his neck. His hands sweat inside the gloves, his sense sharp on the rooftop.

"Think you're outnumbered here, Rob. May want to rethink your offer so we don’t rough you up so bad."

"Luckily, I'm not like Batman," he retorts calmly, pressing the right spot in his glove, "I have *friends*."

A set of lights clicks on inside the warehouse, glaring through the skylight between all of them.

It's a second, a breath, and he throws the pellet between them, snapping it on impact.

Rebreather in his mouth by the time he tackles Renegade with restraints in one hand, going low (*not running this time*) to take him down, closer to the knockout gas.

Hood has already taken the helmet off, so Robin can awkwardly toss the bolo to wrap around Hood’s upper body. He’s telegraphing himself when he shoves his palms flat and throws his legs up and over enough to catch the villain in a straddle to take him down to the ground while Renegade hacks in the knockout gas.

"The *fuck*\--!"

But *nope*. He’s got the helmet off and no rebreather. He can hold his breath a helluva long time, but with Timmy’s move, the air got knocked out of him and he already wheezed to try getting some of it back.

He only gets a glimpse of a gloved hand clenching down on the back of Dickie’s neck to keep ‘im down before he’s--

\-- *out*.

\*\*

For once in his life, he’s grateful Dami is paranoid as *fuck*.

(Obviously a Bat thing.)

Once he hefts Renegade and Hood off the roof and down through the warehouse with the grapple, he locks the place down and arms the outer security. The windows shine, the only indication no one can see in, and first, he deactivates the cameras without setting off any warning alarms the way Dami showed him. He is going to try very, *very* hard not to traumatize Baby Bat any further than helping out with *this* *little escapade* is already going to.

The preparations he made earlier in the day are ready, and Robin pulls off the cape so he can move around more easily.

(Reads as: without tripping himself up and falling on his ass in front of his vigilante significant others when the stage is set.)

He starts with the usual, using his first-hand knowledge on how to get Renegade and Hood out of their suits without shocking the ever-loving shit out of himself.

(*It’s unfair how little padding is in their suits, how this is all just *them* being super hot. Seriously, how is he even supposed to *brain* right now? Nope! Stick to the plan, Tim. Be strong! The reward will be totally worth it.*)

He pulls out the neatly coiled ropes he’d pilfered from the Nightwing trunk hidden in the back of their closet and quickly gets to work, mentally pulling up the YouTube tutorial he’d watched one night while both of them were away.

(And here he’d thought he’d be able to do this the first time in the safety and security of their bedroom, not necessarily for their kinky sex games. But he can’t help but feel this is *better*, the surge of undeniable power with every knotted section is something he can’t deny. It’s heady, this feeling of being in *control*.)

Green for Hood. Blue for Renegade.

*Perfect*.

The part of his brain that is *Robin*, takes a second to test out the makeshift pulley system he’d made earlier in the day, knotting rope precisely to make sure it wouldn’t give. He kneels by Renegade, eyes the lines of delectable collar bone, Nightwing blue highlighting the thickness of his bound wrists, the powerful muscles in shoulders and biceps, draws Robin in–

He shakes himself out of it, uses D-rings to attach Renegades harness before hefting him a few feet off the ground. He adjusts so the harness takes most of the weight. Next, thigh straps to wrap around thigh and calf, make sure the restraints are *secure*.

Hood is next, perfectly fucking *kissable* when he’s relaxed and out of it, but Rob has to be able to maneuver certain ways, so he’s got a plan for the “vilian.”

The bungee is attached to a support beam overhead, and the thick cuffs are definitely the right choice as Robin attaches Hood’s wrists back to hold him up on his knees. The result is Hood’s amazing chest in an artful arch with plenty of room in that perfect lap to *ride*.

From this vantage, he can reach both villains without stretching too far --

(*And it hits him low in the abdomen, the warm and pleasant tingling of arousal, of each knot, each clatter of the rings, each soft sound of sliding rope, of skin slightly pink under the configurations, perfect outlines that makes his mouth water. Just looking at them like this makes him hot down to his toes.*)

\-- and checks them over extensively, looking for any sign of circulation problems before he uses another set of straps to keep the Red Hood on his *knees*.

Exactly where Robin wants him.

When he finally steps back, muffled moans and twitches signal the hour is up and the knockout gas is quickly wearing off.

He darts back to dim the light until the time is just about right to make one hell of an entrance.

\*\*

Coming to ain’t as good as it should be, considerin’ what they came out tonight ta do.

Head not throbbin’ so no concussion, thank fuck, an’ alls he feels is sluggish, like comin’ outta a deep sleep. So’s it takes a hot second ‘fore he notices the pull of his shoulders n’ arms held up behind ‘im. He’s kneelin’ up, not layin’ down, n’ his calves are tied ta his thighs.

But see, this ain’t his first night onna job, yeah? The Red Hood is a man what knows *all *about playin’ hostage. Did plenty while B worked inna shadows, put a plan in place so’s he could make with the *Dark Knight* n’ shit. Those instincts kick the fuck in, hows ta play possum, keep still n’ quiet, wait ta get all deets on the current sitch ‘fore he makes with the consciousness.

A half-ass groan right close and *well, well, well. Ain’t this a pretty picture?*

Dickie is bare ass n’ *beautiful*, blinking down at ‘im from hefted up, all kinds a roped up in the exact right color.

(*That smart little asshole. Hell, just the view beats the fuck outta sittin’ at home readin’ while his boys binge watch shit TV until they give in ta him ‘n change it ta the Great British Bake Off.*)<br>

He can see Dickie’s eyes, hazy but aware within the background a’ the mask, coming offa the knockout sauce.

(*Damn, learned from th’ best, yeah?*)

Hood’s whiteouts are up, too, an’ he’s just as bare ass n’ roped ta the neck. He knows he’s got boots, but th’ rest a’ ‘im’s hanging out f’ the world ta see.

Well, at least their boy got their colors right on.

An’ it’s nothing more n’ just *Robin Code* when Dickie’s head nudges slightly to the left, knee twitchin’ ta the right.

Hood gives a subtle shake of the head, hoping this might be a lil’ more *interestin’* than he’d first imagined. Seems like their Timmy has a plan.

An well, speak a’ the devil and he fucking *appears*.<br>

A low hum, soft in the empty space around them, the second floor prolly. More lights flicker on once they warmed on up.

He can see Dickie better, can make a low, growling noise in the base of his chest, kept muffled by the tape over his mouth. (‘Cause fuck him *sideways*. Baby Boy looks so Mother. Fucking. *Fine*. all wrapped up ‘n ready, begging ta be undone jus’ like this.) Even with the mask and the tape, Hood knows Dickie is smirking back in that *we’ll explore this again* kinda way.

Yeah, yeah. They *will*, mark his *words*.

“That’s better. Glad you two finally woke up from your *nap*. I was getting lonely in your evil lair all on my own.”

Robin’s voice echoes and their gazes snap to him in one coordinated move.

No cape, n’ their boy is tossing pellets in one hand, striding toward them in this nicer, newer suit, his eyes gleaming in the lights.

Behind him, a crate is cracked open, but not a crowbar in sight.

“The GCPD is going to need enough light when they come raid this place, you know,” Robin has their suits and weapons laid out on a stainless steel table close to where they’re tied up *tight*. He holds up Hood’s gauntlet, “and I’d rather you not have these when that happens.”

He drops the gauntlet back, takes a few, measured steps closer, eyes moving over him n’ Dickie like he’s sizing ‘em up, thinking about what he can *do* ta them in this kinda predicament.

Hood makes no move to try n’ hide how fucking *hard* that look makes him.

Dickie ain’t doing much better, leaning back into the harness, arms bound behind ‘im, waitin’ and watchin’ like a predator what found *prey*.

Robin slowly moves around Renegade, eyes sweeping up n’ down, but Hood is already tracking each step, and he catches the *saah* of gloves on skin, soft jangles put inta a palm.

(*It’s why he ain’t at all* surprised* when Timmy moves around behind ‘im too, pauses ta slide a bell in his hand, squeezes his fist in their usual signal. *

*Usually they do this th’ other way ‘round, but he’s glad Timmy learned good practices. Fuckin’ *finally.* But still, his fingers wiggle and clench willingly ta show his hands ain’t numb. No, no, Sweets, ain’t no part a’ him numb right now, ****fuck***.)

“Sorry it has to be like this,” is airy when Robin is apparently satisfied enough ta walk from behind him, gloved fingers trailing feather light over his arm, around to his chest, tracing the ropes around his pectorals. “But, if I don’t take these off the market now, I’ll be taking them off criminals later. This is really the lesser of the two evils.”

He gives Renegade a side look, “not to mention I’m not really *fond* of getting sold to the highest bidder in the criminal underworld. Not the Tuesday evening I was hoping to have anyway.”

And they can both *see it*, how his face gets all pink unner the dom, how he pauses ta bite his lip, automatically kicks out a leg to widen his stance a ‘lil bit.

“...Especially since–” and he slowly slides gloves fingers over his hip, finds a fucking *zipper* in just the right spot, pulls it down while he smirks at them, while his eyes flicker with heat and humor, a whole lotta *gotcha don’t I*?

And Jason Todd is motherfucking *here* for that look.

It’s Timmy before alla the hurt an’ pain the gas dug up, the deep down agonies he still can’t talk about, the trauma they can’t help him *fight*, that they had to find out about like-like *that*. Their boy sobbing and screaming and destroying himself ‘cause everyone he fucking loved always left ‘im.

This smirking little shit is the Timmy what can stand toe-to-toe and keep *fighting*. The one with the spirit of the *Bat* himself.

What drew them to him in the first place.

(*Well, who’s he kidding, that ass n’ pretty face ain’t no joke either*.)

Just seeing it in front of him now makes something tight in Jason Todd’s chest gently start to *ease*.

Fingers over the other hip, another zipper, so the reinforced tights can peel right down, no bodysuit this time.

And neither of the villains know what’s worse, watching that smirk as he reveals the well thought-out suit design, or when he turns to peel the other side down slow to reveal something shiny and *slick* under the tights.

(*He prepped for them. This is fucking *torture*, Timmy*.)

“–I have you both where ***I*** want you this time.”

Hood’s jaw clenches, half-groan behind the tape, both hands grip the bungees attached to his wrists, fights the instinct to get out of them and *move*.

Just a glance tells him Dickie’s rolling his shoulders back ta keep from slippin’ the ropes, too.

Gloved thumbs slide down to open him up jus’ a lil’, just enough ta make his mouth fucking *water*.

But Rob turns before the show gets good, eyes half-mast behind the domino.

“Luckily, I have a few hours before the Bat expects me to check-in, and I intend to make the most of it.” And it’s a teasing glance over his shoulder as Robin steps over to straddle Hood’s lap, putting the villain’s face right in that pert ass.

(*Like this, Jay can’t lunge for him, can’t grip, can’t lick, can’t *bite*. And Tim knows, *he knows.)

It’s all mapped out perfectly when he’s only scant inches from the hanging Renegade, a break in character when he looks up at those dilated blue, blue eyes as he sinks down oh so slow. He wiggles his hips until he’s comfortable over Hood’s lap in a reverse cowgirl, snuggles right up to rub the obvious erection against the plug in his ass. He’s at the perfect distance and height to lean forward just enough to let his breath hit Renegade’s cock.

The moans are muffled, but yeah, *yeah*.

This?

*Priceless*.

Robin slides a hand behind him. The back of his fingers run along Hood’s smooth curve, plays with the plug he’d put in not long before they came to, lets his tongue out to run under the pink tip, rolls his eyes up to meet Renegade’s intense stare.

And it’s really more satisfying than it ought to be, rubbing his ass in the “villain’s” lap while he absently mouths at the other at his own pace, deciding how much to give. He can make Jay watch him play with the plug, sliding it out just a little, just enough for a good stretch, for a good show. He can make Dick writhe against the ropes, straining to get closer to his mouth while his biceps flex, all outlined in blue.

This? Is the literal thing *dreams are made of*.

So he makes it a show to move lower, suck and lick at the base of Renegade’s cock, use the other hand to pull himself open, to torture Hood with light, absent touches.

Just a little tug and he’s so *wet*, so *empty*.

(*This suit design is the best thing to ever happen in the history of getting laid by hot vigilantes, and he will properly make homage as soon as he’s too fucked out to move*.)

It’s incredible to feel Hood strain at the binding on his arms, arch more to push against his empty ass without success, to hear the low grunt when Renegade tries shifting his weight forward to make aborted movements to catch against Robin’s open *mouth*.

(The tease is long, *long* overdue. And he knows with utmost certainty, the next time they all *play* together, he’s going to *get it* for this.

But…

**Worth it.**)

And it’s the best possible high when he gives them a scant few minutes to pull and strain at their bindings trying to get to him, to watch them fight, to feel them struggle above *and* under him. It’s such a sweet moment of *power*.

It’s all his choice, all in his grasp, all in his control.

“Here’s what’s going to happen,” he leans back, fits right in the curve of Hood’s body, lays his head back and gives a soft moan just for them.

He ditches the gloves while starting a soft, rolling rhythm. He wraps an arm around Hood's neck, lets the other run up Renegade’s thigh, toying with the straps.

“I’m going to take what I want, and if you’re both good, I won’t necessarily have to leave you naked like this for the police to find. Deal?”

So it gets to be Robin that shifts enough in Hood’s lap, uses both hands to open himself up, to sink down until the tip sliding in makes him breathe out a satisfied sigh.

It gets to be Robin that takes his time to sink down until he’s sitting in Hood’s bare lap, so full he feels it in his stomach, a breathy keen because he’s so hard, he’s *throbbing*.

It gets to be Robin that grips the ropes at Renegade’s hips, to pull him closer, to sink that beautiful cock into his mouth until he can feel it in his *throat*.

It gets to be Robin that hears the agonized moans from both “villains” (these beautiful, stubborn, over-protective *assholes*) when he sets the rhythm.

He’s the one working his hips and thighs, unrestrained by smart fashion choices.

He’s the one that decides when to work Hood deep and slow or shallow and quick with fast pops of his hips until he feels the struggling under his thighs to get *more*.

He’s the one that chokes and gags himself, sucks back up, plays around the soft tip with his tongue until Renegade is shaking and tossing his head back in his restraints.

He’s the one that sinks down on a hard thrust to shove Hood as far inside as humanly *possible* and pull Renegade into his mouth until he can work his throat around every *inch*.

Hood is the one to go first, yelling behind the tape over his mouth, in utter *agony* ‘cause he can’t move enough, ‘cause their boy is squeezing him so, so *tight*, is takin’ it like he *owns* them, and it’s so fucking hot he can’t even stand it no more.

The bungee strains with his fight, but he doesn’t get anywhere when the orgasm hits him like a burning glow up the spine, chest heaving, legs shaking as Robin sinks down to the base, making sure he comes nice n’ deep with that ass clenching hard, milking him until his eyes almost fucking cross.

He feels Timmy shudder in his lap as he takes it all like a *good boy*.

He’s mostly there when Timmy draws back offa Dickie with a wet noise. Hood has no fucking clue how their boy can stand after just riding him all over *town*, but hands on his chest, Robin’s mask face suddenly all up in his where he’s turned around n’ bent over ta let Dickie’s cock rub at his *pretty*, red hole.

(*An’ he’s doing it with Jay’s come drippin’ out, makin’ him a mess, makin’ it easier to slide Dickie right the fuck in*. *A glance up at that tortured face tells ‘im he’s right onna money, how Big Wing strains ta lookit *that* sight.*)

Hood is finally comin’ down offa the high when Robin groans against the tape, lookin’ utterly *debauched* when he starts movin’.

He knows he’s moaning through the tape himself, knows he might not be hard pressed to get it up again just watching ‘em.

But the logistics aren’t great for this, and Robin gives it a valiant go. Even he gets it when his legs are shaking too much and Renegade is in free swing so he can’t get the depth both of them want right now.

“Dammit,” their boy whimpers, the mask slippin’, breaking the character, when he bites down on his lip because it’s ain’t enough ta bring ‘im. Jay *knows* he needs even *more*.

Unfortunately (or, well *fortunately*), that little pause ‘cause his legs are shakin’ gives them enough of a break to make with the *plan*, yeah?

Being patient, waiting and watching, Renegade *knows* by shaky knees and soft keens, frustrated mumbles, half-hearted thrusts in tight, clenching, *heat*, that this is the moment.

Time to strike.

(*But he’s so fucking *proud* of everything their cute hus*– **boyfriend*****, ****boyfriend* –has accomplished tonight. He’s come so, *so* far in the last few weeks, he’s been so brave and so beautiful, and Dick is so absurdly happy Tim’s given himself the time to heal more than physical injuries, and finally let them just fucking take *care* of him when he needed it. Sure, it was with the usual deflections and denials and distractions, but that’s just *Timmy*. This time, he let them closer than he ever has before, and they’ve come so far, the three of them, that Dick has Every. Intention. of playing along with this cute and sexy little bondage scene, and then they are going to *ravage* their civilian sweetie until he can’t move for at least a day. Promise <3 )

He gets a look over Robin’s bowed back and meets Hood’s eyes in perfect synchronization.

A jerk of his ankle and the sharp edge built in the sole of his boot slides out, a glint in the lights, and since, well, his core is *in-cred-i-ble*, Renegade arches back himself to bring the sharp edge up to slice the ropes binding his wrists together at the small of his back.

He slides wetly out of Robin with the move, but the razor edge cuts flawlessly, frees him, gives him enough time to rip the straps off his legs and arch higher to cut the ropes attached to his harness.

He lands it like a natural, drops the leg straps and slowly pulls at the tape while Robin lets out the *cutest *little *eep!*

He’s moving, eyes wide behind the domino, his face going pink down into the laced-up tunic where they can’t *see*, can’t *touch*. His legs firm slightly while a very naked Renegade releases the bungee from Hood’s hands, lets it *twang* back into the warehouse, and *oh.* *Oh this was not in the plan*.

\*\*

Hood’s on his feet right over Renegade’s shoulder, looking downright *dangerous* with a deadly smirk.

The rope harnesses are still incredible.

Naked villains that might hold a grudge.

*(Hot boyfriends that look like they want to *devour* him. Mission accomplished*.*)*

A hand clenches in the side of his loose tights, covers himself, takes a step *back* without face-planting.

(*None of the bells drop which means the game is still on.*)

Both villains intently watch him take another tiny step back, but Robin doesn’t bother with words, just slowly palms a grapple from the side table. He lets it hang at his side pointedly in a *dare*, already pulling the zipper on one side to give himself as much of an advantage as he possibly can.

That familiar shiver of anticipation runs up his spine as Hood reaches for the gauntlets that really could make things *interesting*.

They’re both ready for it, muscles tense in beautiful lines, all scars and skin and the start of adrenaline thickening the space between him and them.

“We’re not *done* with you, Robin.” The deep growl comes from the base of Renegade’s chest.

“Gotta have his, didn’ he? ‘Bout time fer us ta get *ours*, you feel me?” Hood tosses Renegade his gauntlets, doesn’t bother with bodysuits and gloves. He doesn’t look away from Robin inching closer to railing behind him, a drop to the first floor below. “Don’t cha think ‘bout it, lil’ bird. Ya ain’t called the fuzz yet. No comm, no Batsy, n’ yer belt’s over ‘ere,” a thumb over his shoulder by the incriminating evidence neatly ready for what should have been a clean get-away.

“Tell you what,” and it’s all *slick* from Renegade’s grinning mouth, “we’ll call it even. Get a nice fuck and you leave this shipment alone. Tell the Bats it was an easy patrol. Next time, bring your A game again. This time, we get what we want and you get what you want.” He slides a hand down to grip himself at the base, gives a few strokes for *incentive*.

And Robin’s mouth goes just a little dry watching, wanting, at war with the same instinct to *fucking run*.

“I-” and he swallows, his voice hoarse, his ass still open and slick, “I think you’ll have to catch me first.”

It’s only practice that makes him able to fire the grapple to latch without looking.

He’s got the *advantage* here. He’s smart, he’s fast, he’s in the right colors tonight, and that is all the reason in the world to turn and make the *leap*.

“Fuck *yes*,” Dickie is just in the face mask, but that don’t mean he can’t see the *anticipation* right there in how his incredible ass clenches. “Best surprise play date ever.”

Hood smirks, gauntlets already locked on his forearm, hip cocked out so he’s all *kinds* of on display. “Well, idn’t it how we *like it*, Big Wing? He ain’t goin’ down easy, an ‘at’s how we like him.”

“True, but let’s get on with it. I’m ready to fuck him into a coma now and then *cuddle*,” is more cheerful than a baddie oughta sound, but that’s s’allright. Hood can work with it.

\*\*

What he should have thought about is how massive the old warehouse is and how epically clean it is on the upper floors, but the ground-level is a mess.

(*Just another Bat paranoia really*.)

He knows a hidden elevator moves to underground floors with makeshift infirmary, training areas, lab space, and other vehicles for various crime fighting purposes. He knows the locked-down upper floors have an immaculate sitting room, kitchen, and two bedrooms. All making it the perfect nest when shit sometimes gets *real*.

The ground-level, however, still has original machinery and conveyor belts from the time of the big industrial boom and subsequent years of technological upgrades as well as storage and packaging. He knows he has plenty of places to hide, to plan out some kind of attack, to find higher ground.

(*But at the same time, he just wants them to catch him, to pin him, spread him, own him* –)

And in some fucked-up kind of way, even if he *wants*, something in his brain pan still rails against making it easy, against just giving* in*. So, he’s trying hard to control his breathing, focuses on being utterly *silent* in the way he knows Jay and Dick can absolutely be. The breaker panel still makes a soft *creak* when he pries it open with a Bat-a-rang and flips the old machinery on.

Lights on the bottom floor flare to life, mechanical hum and the belts start moving. All of it the perfect camouflage.

He fumbles a bit to get the retractable bo out of the hidden pocket inside the tunic he’s still wearing, but the effort is worth it when he spots the two villains silently splitting up to track him, purposefully not sticking to the shadows while stalking him.

He ducks under a conveyor belt, blood pumping hot as a pair of boots and bare calves pass on one side. He’s still got the grapple, peaking out to keep low to track Renegade a few feet back as automated arms assemble boxes to stack in haphazard piles.

The villain pauses, and in a move he once saw in a cartoon, Robin snatches a box and slides it over his head. For long seconds, he stays still under it, blind with what seems like so little air, but even with his pulse beating, he can hear the soft noise, the *hmm* close enough to reach out and grab an ankle.

Instead, he pulls some of the grapple line, fumbles a knot, flips it out gently, bites his lip to hope the villain doesn’t look *down*.

His ass *throbs* in anticipation when the line pulls taunt.

The* surprise vigilante!* moment he’s been waiting for comes when he shoves himself to his feet, box and all, and *yanks*.

Renegade goes down, precious seconds for Robin to loop the line around both ankles so the grapple gun he’d nudged in the legs of the boxing machine can hold. Like this, he can hold Renegade’s wrists long enough to slap a gloved hand down over his mouth.

“Quiet,” he hisses down at the villain, moves his hand off to shove the tights down because if he doesn’t get Dick’s cock in the next few *seconds*, he’s going to *lose his mind*.

He moans softly when the air hits his bare ass, still wet with Hood’s come. It’s an awkward stretch to keep wrists pinned in one hand and open himself with the other, trying to catch the tip enough to sink down.

“That’s it. All this duck and run just shows how badly you *want it*. Even if you didn’t come here for the *inventory*, you’d still want to sit on my cock and fucking *take it*, wouldn’t you?”

“Shut up,” he snarls, shifting to work his wet ass against the throb of Renegade’s obvious erection.

“Don’t worry, sweetheart,” and Renegade’s sharp grin almost *cuts*. “You’re gonna get exactly what you *deserve*.” The grit in that tone makes him go hot down to his *toes*.

They both shift the right way, moving a little desperately until the right angle makes Robin bite down on his lower lip and Renegade arch his back to shove his hips up enough to push in.

It’s hot being in Dick’s lap like this, to feel fingers wrap around his gloved hand even if the wrists are still pinned, feel the squeeze that reminds him this is just hazy play overtop his amazing, wonderful, vigilante boyfriends.

He breaks the fantasy for a moment when he dips down to shove his tongue in the villain’s mouth, sinks slowly, so they can groan in each other’s mouth.

He pulls back just enough to raise up and slap his hips back *down*.

And it’s so, so *good*. His eyes water every time he gets the angle right to hit that *spot*, to make his cock twitch and drool against those incredible abs, to squeeze back on the wrists in his grip, to work his hips shallow and deep when his legs start to shake again.

“That’s it, *fuck me*,” Renegade groans under him, throws his head back, baring his throat to Robin’s hot gaze. “Little do-gooder rides cock like a pro. What would the Bat say about this, huh? Wouldn’t like you spreading your legs for the bad guys, would he? Guess what he doesn’t know won’t hurt us, right?”

Even with how flexible he is, Renegade doesn’t try to take over, doesn’t try to flip them to be on top, he lets Robin stay in control.

(*For the moment*.)

“S-selling me o-out,” and a surge, hips thrusting *up* almost makes him go cross-eyed, “ah* fuck*! Is-is such a bad idea. You don’t even know what I - *oh, oh, ooohhh* \- what I can do once I -*ah,aaahh*\- put my mind to it.”

And Robin can feel his eyes burning, watering at the corners because he’s finally, *finally *getting close–

–before the gloved hand slaps over his mouth and jerks him up without dislodging Renegade.

“Gotch a point there, don’tcha *birdie*?”

Fingers scrabble over the tunic, find the catch. The distraction gives Renegade the chance to grip his hips, pull him down to grind. His noises are caught behind Hood’s glove.

He gives a full body shudder, hands coming up to grip that massive forearm, hot, flushed skin cooling when the zipper pulls down.

“Maybe we oughta letcha show us what cha can do, yeah? Give us a *reason* not ta make a mint off’n yer sweet ass.” And the breath against his ear, the kiss of teeth over the lobe makes him wheeze through his nose because Hood is hard against his back again, throwing all his well-constructed plans right out the window.

A fast, sloppy zip tie job keeps his wrists pinned to his back and the manhandling includes just enough struggle to make it look *good*.

Hood literally pulls him off Renegade’s cock by lifting him up with forearms under his knees, holding him open enough to fuck up into him. Renegade snatches something from his reacquired gauntlets, a slim vial, and soaks his middle and ring fingers knowingly.

(*And here it comes back to fingerstripes yet again. How is this even his life?*)

Hood fucks into him while Renegade stretches him more, and he can only keen and shake when his spot is abused over and over and over.

The position puts most of his weight against Hood’s chest, tilts his hips at an angle for Renegade to watch him, to slip a third one in with a groan, and finally to knee walk close enough to start working the tip of his cock in alongside.

(*His brain is static and he’s desperate, so fucking desperate, for this, for them, to prove he can take it, he can walk beside them and keep moving forward.*)

The slick slide against his already stuffed ass makes him tense a little, a spike of fear making it through the intense fucking, the time he’s spent on the edge.

Renegade (*Dick*) flicks his whiteouts up, leans in and breaks character. “Timmy,” low and soft, “what color?”

Jay slows, just grinds up in little circles, breathes against his ear.

“D-Don’t stop,” because *I can take it, I can do this* is always the default answer.

“He asked fer yer *color*, Sweets. An’ yer gonna answer ‘im. No bullshit now, yeah?”

Shuddering breath, his head thumps back against Jay’s shoulder, the rope of the harness rubbing against him, the outline *he* made.

After a second to shift and wiggle down against their hold on him, to take Dick just a little *more*, he can safely open his eyes and say, “Green. All Green here. Now, *Fuck. Me.*”

And heaven help him, they *do*.

At this juncture in their relationship, he should *know* what Dick and Jason are capable of.
