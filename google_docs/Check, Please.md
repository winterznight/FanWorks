Check, Please

*I’m going to hell, but… Parse, Bitty, and Jack or PB&J as I’ve seen it, have some wonderful stories in the fandom, and tbh I’ve come to look at Kent Parsons very differently thanks to a few. You can probably check them out on my Ao3 bookmarks and such. *

*Notes: *

*I know shit all about hockey but damn if I don’t love Check, Please! Not everything is accurate and some details are mine. Like, I’m just going to pretend the Bruins aren’t in Providence, and the Pawtucket Rebels are the AHL team. *

*But then, what if Jack and Bits didn’t get that kiss at the end of Jack’s graduation? What if they just stayed the best of friends, pining away at one another until Kent Parson comes back into Jack’s life. Now it’s not just Jack pining, it’s Kent too :D*

*And, well, after winning the Championship his senior year, bringing that back to Samwell, Eric Bittle might just think he hasn’t had enough Hockey after all.*

*Really, it’s time to put up or shut up.*

## \*\* Pro

Of all the things on Kent Parson’s *Wish List* (winning the Stanley Cup, being on a team he loves, playing hockey for the rest of his life, having a pet and *Kit* meets all those criteria for so much cute and cuddly), getting his friendship back on track with Jack Zimmermann hadn’t moved down from number 1, ever.

Things changed after that disaster at his college frat house, then later in Zimm’s first season with the Falconers, Kent wasn’t sure it could even be a *wish*.

When it came to hockey, things were always too easy. They never had to talk about it, about what they were doing on the ice. All of that just came like *breathing*. Parse and Zimms, Zimms and Parse. The whole Zimmermann-Parson No-Look One-Timer was never something they discussed, it was something that just *happened*.

On the ice, they were unbeatable, just like in Juniors.

Off the ice...was a different story.

(*Sometimes* *he dreams about it, finding Jack passed out on the bathroom floor of the hotel, foaming at the mouth, panic and adrenaline hitting Kent hard when he’s pretty sure his best friend, the man he almost-kind of-sometimes loves, is going to die on this floor.*)

Jack’s problem with pills started early, around the time he and Kent got serious enough to play for scouts that started coming around with the promise of watching the son of Bad Bob.

(*He was always partially to blame for Jack’s downfall. Kent had been the closest to Jack back then, had seen the signs, had tried to pull him back whenever he could, had been the one to ease Zimms down before every game, to be the one sitting in a corner with the bigger Canadian, running his hands over Jack’s shoulders and holding his hands, checking his breathing, helping him work through the anxiety.*)

But, *but!*

That’s all old history, something Jack probably never wants to revisit ever again (*because he cut you out of his life so well–*), even when he makes it to the Falconers.

(*After that disaster at his school, well, no wonder*.)

And Kent just has to deal with that, has to accept it finally, and just *move on*.

(*He could have been an Ace, just that fast, playing with Kent’s team of awesome guys. And fuck did it hurt when Jack turned him down flat...*)

Until this little shit came along.

## \*\* 1

Eric Bittle realizes he’s severely messed up when he doesn’t kiss Jack Zimmermann at graduation.

For two years, they’ve played hard hockey for Samwell, have gotten close, becoming best friends. They’ve held checking clinics, hugged tightly in cellys, watched boring as hell history documentaries on that god-awful green couch, and pulled each other back from the brink of insanity during midterms and finals. They’ve spent time in the kitchen with Bitty cooking and Jack working at the table. They’ve spent time outside in the quad, bullshittin’ like the oldest friends, chirpin’ back n’ forth like they’re two peas in a pod.

Jack somehow started being his best friend without even trying.

The last game showed him how close they’d become when he’s going through the empty rink, making it to the loading dock, just a flash of jersey leading him to Jack hunched over, tears in his eyes.

The utter agony right there had gone through Bitty like lightning, driving him forward to hop up on the pallets Jack was sitting on, and wrap both arms around those wide shoulders, hold on to ‘im as tight as he can.

“It ain’t your fault, Jack. You did so good with us. I’m so proud of you, honey, you have no idea. You worked so hard, so *hard*, Jack.”

“Bits,” is soft and sad, Jack choking a little, but those big arms come around him, crush him against Jack’s chest and the pads he’s still wearing.

“I know, I know. Sometimes it just isn’t in the cards, no matter how hard we fight. You get that, don’t you? Sometimes it just is what it is.”

“I can’t–” *accept* *that* is what Jack wants to say.

“I know it’s hard, but sometimes all the trainin’ and plannin’ and best of intentions just aren’t enough to tip the scales in your favor.”

And Jack seems to get something there, tightens his arms a little more, and holds on.

It’s a little while later when Jack’s stopped shaking like a leaf, “I wanted to bring home a Championship. Wanted to make my mark on Samwell.”

“Of course you did–”

“Thought after all this time, everything I *owe* Samwell and the team, bringing me here, giving me this second chance–”

“Oh Jack,” at this juncture, Bittle’s head is under Jack’s chin.

“I finally felt like I’d stopped fucking up,” is rough and dark in the quiet of the rink. “I thought coming to Samwell was a...a punishment. I dealt with it because I thought my life was going to start after, when I finished up my degree and got back into the Draft. But that’s...that’s not how it happened. My life started the minute I met you and the team and I remembered why the hell I love hockey so damn much in the first place.”

And if maybe a few slow, shameful tears escaped Bitty, well, no one would ever know.

But they got even closer as Jack’s graduation loomed, and Eric Bittle stayed in his own personal hell of loving Jack so much it ached, but helpless to stay away to protect himself.

Instead, when Jack pauses at his door, Bits knows what he needs and finds space to lounge on Jack’s bed, scrolling through Twitter while Jack talks about the negotiations with NHL teams or works on his last assignments.

Watching Jack pack his things, preparing for the Falconer’s training camp, getting ready for the next stage of his life, all of it makes Bits so dang proud and so sad at the same time.

But, well, nothin’ lasts forever, now does it.

When Jack ran all the way back to the Haus just to see him, just to pull him in hard for a desperate last hold, it was all Bits could do to stop from sobbing his heart out.

“–and you’re coming to Providence this summer to stay with me for a while, and-and I’ll be down when I can. You’re going to Skype me all the time. Bits, promise me. All the time.”

“Okay, Jack. Okay.”

Something soft in French that he has no idea what it could possibly mean, but he absolutely imagines Jack pressing a kiss in his hair.

“I’m sorry, Bits, but I have to go. I...I’ll text you, okay?”

“Okay,” is more watery than he’d like, but he can look up in Jack’s blue, blue eyes and at least feel warm that he’s had this man for as long as he has. When Jack’s hands slide out of his, he somehow doesn’t feel like he’s losing anything at all.

## \*\*

And just like that, Jack takes a step in his life he never could have predicted. Like an hour away instead of across the hall is enough to keep holding on, enough that Jack comes to Madison over the summer, enough that he asks Bitty to show him how to use FaceTime and SnapChat.

It’s enough for Jack to pick him up off his feet every time they meet up and bury his face in Bitty’s hair. It’s enough for Jack to Skype almost nightly while he’s tuckered out in his bed, talking about the joys and pitfalls of being a professional athlete.

It’s enough that he gets to meet the Falconers long before preseason starts, and the amount of pies he brings is literally *obscene*.

(It all works out just fine in the end because he goes home with the empty pans. Not a single slice left.)

It’s enough when Jack talks more about life than hockey sometimes, and Bitty is utterly helpless to stop any of it. And it’s funny, he thinks, how he was sure Jack would just flitter out of his life after a while. That they would be reduced to a Skype call once a week maybe when they find the time, then once a month, then not at all, moving into texting once and a while until Jack would be nothing more than one of his best memories of Samwell.

It’s funny how he thought Jack moving into the NHL, moving to Providence, moving out of the Haus, moving *on* with his *life*, would mean also moving on from Eric Bittle.

And my, how wrong he was about all that.

Watching Jack play with the Falconers from the stands with the Stanley Cup on the line is not really where he’d thought he’d be once Jack had graduated.

But, if anything else, they’ve gotten even closer than before.

And when the buzzer finally sounds and the Falconers win it, he’s among the crowd running out on the ice for the biggest celly of the year.

Jack spots him immediately, grabs him up with a victorious roar, and skates around people holding Bitty like a favorite toy until Tater scoops him up from Jack yelling about “Nook pies!”

Marty skates by him, ruffling his hair with something twinkling in his eye. Thirdy hauls him up, too, though Bitty has no idea *why* all these hockey players are just throwing him around when they’ve just won the Stanley Cup, but he still thinks it’s awful nice of them to include him in their celebration.

He doesn’t go back to Georgia for the summer after all or the next one before he starts his senior year, but goes between staying in Jack’s guest room and the Haus instead. His Mama’s not happy about it at all, but he’s a grown man, so that’s all she can say about that.

So Bitty passes the summer of his Senior year training with Jack or at Faber when the ice is up for grabs, works on some chapters for his someday cookbook, and continues his vlog so everyone can see how superior filo is to choux in the right circumstances.

With the season over after winning the Cup, Jack is over at the Haus more than ever if Bitty’s not in Providence already staying in his guest room.

It should be strange to answer the door at the Haus on Saturday morning during the summer and see Jack there in his trainers, sweats, and t-shirt, wanting to hang out for the day after he’d put in a few hours at the Falc’s stadium already.

(“C’mon, Bits. Can’t slack during the summer. You’re the *captain*. Set an example.”

“Jack, it’s summer. Leave me alone until at least nine am for goodness sake!”

“Not going to happen, bud.”)

It should be strange riding the train or in the passenger seat of Jack’s SUV on their way to Providence while he fiddles with the music and Jack doesn’t complain about the selection.

It should be strange to wake up on Jack’s couch, laying on a broad shoulder with a heavy arm flopped around Bitty’s waist and logs being sawed in his ear.

It should be strange to know Jack’s kitchen better than the back of his hand, and to be giddy every time there’s a new utensil bought with him in mind.

(“Jack, why in the *world* would you need a dough scraper of all things?”<br>

“Not for me, Bits.”

“O-Oh!”

“Yeah. Thank Tater. He went with me this time. He held up that and said, ‘*oh does B have one of these? It looks important.*’ I didn’t know so I bought it in case.”)

It should be strange to see Jack’s Skype requests almost every night before bed, or have his former captain sprawled out in Bitty’s full sized bed once Lardo, Ransom, and Holster are already moved out and the new Waffles are well into the first semester of his senior year.

(“Good Lord, Jack, scoot over!”

“Mm.” Jack scootches maybe a foot more so Bitty can climb in beside him, already yawning. “Comfy, bud?”

“Gettin’ there,” and he absolutely ignores how much easier he falls asleep when Jack throws a heavy arm over him.)

It should be strange for Jack to whip him on up in a big hug when he admits the boys voted him as the Captain, and Jack breathes out, “*damn right*,” too close to his ear.

(“I don’t know if I can do this, Jack.”

“Too bad, Bits. Looks like you’re already doing it.”)

It should be strange for Jack to chirp him about his thesis, about his struggle with Whiskey, about why this darn strudel just won’t turn out right.

(“Jaques Laurant Zimmermann, do *not* make me ground you from pie.”

“Haha. I know you wouldn’t do that, bud.”

“Oh? Don’t be so sure, Mister.”)

It should be strange to get an earful when his new video comes out and Jack had *no idea* the jam war was that serious while Bitty has been supplying the Falconers for nearly a year.

(“Are you kidding? Aunt Judy is really that upset?”

“You have no idea, honey. It’s almost World War III down there.”

“Good thing you’re stuck at Samwell.”

“Good thing is right! I don’t want any part of that mess.”)

But somehow it never is. Strange, that is, to have Jack so much. Even though nothing could happen between them (*“Never fall for a straight boy.”*), Bitty still can’t let go of Jack, can’t deny him, can’t tell him *no*, can’t be the one that fails to respond when Jack reaches out for him.

Even when Kent Parson shows up at a Falcs game and cheers himself hoarse, screams for Jack right there on live TV.

And while trying to get through his dang senior year, trying to get his team to the Eastern Conference, he watches how Jack and Kent start to move back in one another’s orbit.

...which is probably why he doesn’t tell Jack anything about the scouts from the AHL coming to see him after the game with Princeton.

## \*\* 3

The Pawtucket Rebels manager, Michael McLean, is the one that meets Bitty with a Standard Player Contract the morning he gets back from Jack’s place – right when they’re going to be starting in the Frozen Four if they win the next two games.

The weekend away was nice, but he hadn’t been expecting Jack’s intention to “introduce” him to Kent Parson of the Las Vegas Aces.

“We’ve already met,” Bitty had filled in, still shaking Kent’s hand with a distant smile on his face, “at the Haus party when he swung on by.”

“Not my best moment,” the Captain admits sheepishly, eyes not meeting Bitty’s, and dang it if the boy ain’t at least a little bit cute.

“I suppose we all have our days,” Bits just drawls out and gives him a wink. He holds out the plate of fresh cookies as some kind of peace offering.

The weekend was still nice, being caught up in Kent’s manic energy and Jack’s easy acceptance. But, he starts seeing the signs pretty easily, when Jack’s hand goes to Kent’s shoulder after a good joke, the exchanged glances that linger, the slowly dwindling personal space that used to be there between them. How they start finishing each other’s sentences, and *oh*, doesn’t it just make his heart give a little beat when he sees them both happy.

(*But doesn’t that just break it at the same dang time. Not only does Jack like men, but he’s already got his sights set on his old boyfriend. It’s almost enough to make a grown man cry. Bitty consoles himself after breaking down in his room on Sunday when Jack and Kent dropped him off at the Haus*. *Only Senor Bun knew how much he’d ugly cried himself out that night.*)

When Mr. McLean gives him the contract to peruse and a business card with his information circled in blue pen, Bitty almost picks up his phone to call Jack, talk about what he would need other than a lawyer to go over this thing.

He thinks about Kent and calls Coach and Mama the next morning instead, promises to send scanned copies of the contract. Mama asks if this is something he really wants to think about doing after graduation.

“It’s money, Mama, a *lot* of money, and who knows?” Good *Lord *is it alot. “Hockey might not be outta my heart just yet. I’ll still have time for everything else.”

He only feels a little bit bad when Jack Skypes him on a roadie, set-up in a hotel, asks how his darn thesis is going, and promises to be at the next home game.

Kent joins the call while Bits is slid down all snug and sleepy-eyed, kids around with him by making kissy faces.

“College is brutal, Bits. You aren’t sleeping enough.”

“Well, now that’s life, ain’t it?”

Bitty knows something’s going on between them because Kent is shaking a finger at the screen and lecturing him about procrastination while Kit snoozes on. He’d only known about the thesis if Jack told him about it.

“Bits, your thesis is basically about baking. Baking is the thing you love that isn’t hockey.”

“That doesn’t make it any easier,” Bitty slurs tiredly, wondering how he’s talking to the man that’s swiping his unrequited crush right out from under him even though he doesn’t even feel too bad about it. Not when he sees how good Kent is for Jack now, even if that hadn’t always been the case.

(*Long as it makes Jack happy, I can endure it. It’s tough, but I’m tougher.*)

But really. Kent Parson is so different from his image as the Captain of the Aces, Bitty can’t help but genuinely *like* the man.

“I’m so jealous. I *love* peppermint cookies and I’ve *never* gotten any sent to me!”

Sleepy-time Bitty makes a note of that even when the world fuzzes out a little bit more.

“*God, he’s so *cute*, Zimms.”*

“*Euh. He really is, Kenny. We should hang-up and let him sleep.*”

Or he might have just dreamed that part.

The Aces have a hard game coming up, and he’s got his outline done, so the Haus is finally going to let him alone long enough to bake one single, solitary pie. In the middle of it, he certainly doesn’t expect Jack to show up with a six pack of Molson Blue, apparently assuming they’re going to watch it together and cheer on Kent.

“But I expect you to cheer for the Falcs when it comes down to us and the Aces, Bits.”

“Oh honey, I always root for the underdog anyhow.”

The chirp makes Jack flop back on his bed and laugh hard enough for tears to be in his eyes. Bitty just goes back to the Aces on his laptop and drinks Jack’s awful beer with a smirk.

He stirs a little from sleep to Jack talking softly beside him in bed since *“It’s too late to drive back to Providence tonight. Move over, bud.”*

He mutters something maybe, sighing instead when fingers comb through his hair.

“*That W was perfection, Parse. You were skating your best life out there, eh?*...*sleeping right now. Yeah, senior year is a pain in the ass...you bet I miss you. Three weeks, we’ll be close enough to Vegas...yeah, I’ll try to get him to come along, but the Wellies are getting closer to the Championship...he would kill to bring it home for the boys.*”

But he probably imagined all that, too.

Still, he’s got a short break before the next round of games, and just five days until his deadline to let Mr. McLean have his answer when Jack shows up at the Haus and is apparently confused why Bitty isn’t packed for Vegas.

“What do you mean we’re going to Las Vegas, Jack?!” Because this is the first *he’s* heard about it, and how does Jack already have a plane ticket for him?

“Come off it, bud. If I go there without you, Kenny will never forgive me.”

“How does he even *know* I don’t have a game?” He frets while putting sleep shorts in a suitcase, wonders if he should bring one of his suits since Jack is already wearing one.

Jack’s brows scrunch together, “Don’t you talk to him on that–that bird one? All the time? He says he always reads your updates.”

He pauses with a pair of boxer briefs and gives Jack his very best unimpressed expression, “Jack, sweet pea, please tell me you didn’t just refer to Twitter as *that bird one*?” He carefully does not say anything about Kent Parson checking his Twitter updates.

The soft smile and shrug in reply answers that now doesn’t it.

“I swear, what would you do without me,” he sighs, a little throb of love getting caught in his chest, and he just busies himself right on past it, going for at least one pair of flip flops probably buried under mounds of winter gear.

“Honestly? If I didn’t have y– Samwell these last few years, maybe it would have been like what happened when I was in the Q,” Jack leans back on his elbows on Bitty’s bed, right beside the suitcase he’s quickly trying to pack. Being stuck between two button-ups, biting his bottom lip because he’s already bringing *so much* takes a backseat when Jack mentions the days he was in Juniors, and Bitty feels his eyebrows raise.

“When we started checking clinics, you and me, that was the most...balanced I ever started feeling after all that. The, ah, overdose. That...that might have been where I ended up if it hadn’t been for you and Samwell.”

With a breath (because *Lord*, here was Jack finally talking about it, in such a soft tone, his eyes so very blue, and just! Well, he’s not made of *stone* and this is *Jack*), he scoots the suitcase back and plops right down on the bed, reaching for Jack’s hand. He carefully looks at the closed door and rubs those big fingers with his thumb.

“You honestly think you would have made those same mistakes without this, Jack?” He tries to be nice about it, “because I sure as heck don’t.”

His fingers tighten around Bitty’s, a squeeze, a soft *thank-you*.

“I mean, I didn’t know you back then, so I can’t say who you were, but there are some parts of that Jack left in the one I know now. And the Jack I know now is someone that knows how to lead his team, and takes care of them, who knows how to inspire them. The Jack I know got up extra early just to help this hopeless case learn to overcome his fear and be able to play hockey better than he ever could have before. You helped me not just be able to take a check, but I’m a captain, a center, and I earned it because of you. The Jack *I* know is selfless in so many ways and selfish in just the right ones, and *dang it*, he’s my best friend, so you better not say anything else like that about him again.”

The bed shifts under him when Jack sits up, a big hand coming up to palm the side of Bitty’s face so Jack can lean his forehead in, look straight at him from just *inches* away with those stupidly big blue eyes, and be so *warm* and just *Jack*.

“You were never *hopeless*, Bits,” and with his voice that low, being this close, Bitty feels his cheeks getting warm, his eyes helplessly sliding down to Jack’s mouth.

The errant thought *Vegas, we’re going to Vegas *shakes him out of the moment, and he pats Jack’s forearm, gently pulling back from the very intense, heart-stopping moment where his brain almost killed him when it told him to just *go on* and kiss Jack.

But his brain also knows it would probably be the last thing he’d ever do with Jack because Jack has Kent for that now, doesn’t he?

Mentally shaking himself, Bitty stands quickly, goes back to his suitcase, “All right, now for heaven’s sake, Jack, *help me here*. I’ve never been to Las Vegas–”

And it’s not *nearly* as hot in Georgia as it is in Las Vegas when they get off the plane, but everything else about it is incredible.

(*He doesn’t think about how nice it was to ride next to Jack on the plane, talking strategy and the team, the upcoming games and new plays they might bring to the ice. It’s nice to hear about the Falcs eating his peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with hollers for more. The pies never last long and cookies are always a favorite.*)

He might have worried for about a minute, fiddling with the Uber app on his phone to update his location, but Jack just lays a hand on his back and guides him out of the terminal.

“Don’t worry about it, Bits, we’ve got a ride.”

And standing by a *stunning* red Ferrari is Kent Parson himself, grinning wide under his sunglasses.

“Oh *my*,” even if it’s a little breathless, he gives himself an out here because *wow*, it’s a nice car.

(And he is not at *all* looking at Kent’s bare arms or muscled calves. Absolutely *not*. He’s already got one heartache, thank-you very much.)

He still squeaks a little when Kent literally picks him up off his feet and swings him around.

“There’s my guys! Falcs and Rebs!” Kent yells for half the airport to hear.

Jack blinks and Bitty groans softly.

Those blue eyes aren’t accusing him of anything, but it’s that same confused look when he tries to figure out if the next song is Destiny’s Child or Queen Bey herself.

“Rebs?”

He doesn’t wince, but it’s a close thing.

“I’ll...tell you about it later.” He waves off, deflecting perfectly, and snaps up his luggage again now that he’s on his feet.

“*Oh*,” Kent looks from him to Jack and back to him, and his mouth opens probably to say something else no one else needs to hear.

“Thank-you for coming to pick us up, by the way,” he starts rambling right on, “I’ve never been to Las Vegas before. And we’re even going to watch a game? How exciting! Should I make something for your team? A good luck something maybe? Is there a grocery store close to your house? Can we stop? Maybe I could do a few apple pies and a strawberry one...?”

“You can make me food all day, B,” Kent smiles so wide and white down at him and just swipes his bag right up out of Bitty’s hand like it weighs nothing at all. “My favorite pie is peach, just in case you were wondering.”

Bitty slaps him right on the arm, absolutely *offended*. “Kenneth Virgil Parson the Third, like I wouldn’t already *know* what your favorite pie is! Why of all the nerve!”

And that is how Bitty talked himself right out of the AHL conversation with Jack. At least, for the time being.

\*\*

In the end, he makes two apples, two strawberries, and three peach pies, one for Kenny to keep at home.

Jack mutters under his breath about the Falcs needing a peach pie, and Bitty can absolutely do that once they get back home.

The boys are wonderful at keeping him company in Kent’s big kitchen while he works, staying out of his way unless he directs them.

“It’s not going to be a *super* exciting game. The Schooners are old rivals since before I came to the Aces,” Kenny shrugs, fish oven mitts on, and his own apron is really just Kit’s face blown up on a white background.

But the man’s fish oven mitt is–

Wait for it

– named *Fish*.

Because Kent is a master at naming things, obviously.

Kit Puurson is laying on the kitchen table from where Bitty banished her from walking along the counters while he’s baking.

“Now, don’t sell it short, sugar pie,” Bitty replies absently, makes the lattice on the last pie *perfect*. The A in the center is going to be great once the pie finishes baking. “It’s going to be exciting to see you play live no matter what.”

“Aw,” and Kent is smiling all nice at him now that he probably knows Bitty’s not gunning for his boyfr- for *Jack*, “you’re just saying that because it’s true.”

“Of course I am, Kent. It *is* true.”

“Any time you get bored of watching the Falcs, all you have to do is call me, Bits. I’ll have you on a plane in a hot minute,” and Bitty has to look over at him for that because it might have been a chirp at Jack, but the tone was a lil’ too serious for his taste.

“Who knows, Mister Parson, I might take you up on that someday.”

(*When hell freezes over*.)

“I hope so, Bits,” Kent’s eyes go to the masterpieces on the counter waiting for their turn in the oven, “I really hope so.”

\*

At the game later that night, before the Aces take the ice, Bitty gets a Snap from Kent Parson.

All the pie pans are licked clean. Not a crumb in sight.

Bitty sighs in unmitigated *relief*.

Even though he feels strange not wearing a Falconers or Samwell jersey when he’s at a hockey game, he can’t blame Jack for leaving their home team merchandise back in Providence.

Earlier, Kent had tugged an Ace's jersey over his head and landed a cap as the cherry on top, winking at him while Jack was busy grumbling to himself about something or other.

It feels odd to have someone’s name across his back other than his own (or frankly *Zimmermann* because Jack already gave him two hoodies and several other Falcs shirts, which was real kind of him, and they’re such nice clothes!), but his Mama would fly up from Georgia and whoop his butt good if she knew he’d refused a gift from a celebrity.

So, even with Jack scowling, he accepts the jersey and hat for the game tonight.

He and Jack find their seats, right behind the bench, and it looks like they can finally settle in.

Jack keeps a running monologue of stats and predictions, leaning in to Bitty while eating the carrot sticks they'd packed in so Jack wouldn't be tempted with junk food.

This boy and his rigid schedule of cheat days. Honestly.

And Bitty is content to talk hockey and the upcoming season, is content to talk about the Samwell team and the next game coming up.

He gets to watch Kent and the Aces make an opening lap around the rink to wave at their fans, laughs at the finger guns right in their direction.

He settles on in to watch what will probably be a good game no matter what Kent said earlier, and of course, Jack chooses then of all times to bring it up.

"Are you going to tell me about the Rebels anytime soon?” Jack is watching the game when he finally says it, something in his tone of voice that sounds a little closer to mad.

Bitty looks over, guilty as sin, and Jack looks back, all kinds of calm.

“I...I didn’t make a decision or anything–” he starts then turns away from those blue eyes. “I-I should go get us something to drink! Jack, what do you want to–”

He’s halfway out of his chair, but Jack’s hand on his wrist stops him, pulls him back down to his seat.

“Don’t be mad!” Bitty sighs, loud and long, “I didn’t even know what to do when Mr. McLean came to see me.”

Jack hums, “You could have called your best friend who happens to be a professional hockey player.”

“That will be enough chirps outta you, Mister Zimmermann. You were already having a time with the changes to your medication, and I didn’t want to add anything else to your list.”

Jack guffaws at him, “that was two months ago, Bits, and my anxiety is under control. You could have told me anytime since then.”

“Well, I–” and Bitty has a moment where his mouth almost runs right away with him, and he almost tells Jack they ain’t datin’ so not everything has to be out in the open.

“You?”

And even though Kent has the puck, Jack’s eyes are all for Bitty.

“Jack,” he sighs, rubbing the bridge of his nose.

“You can tell me anything. You know that, right bud?” And that line between his eyebrows lets Bitty know Jack is actually concerned.

“Of course, Jack, I...I just. I don’t know, you’ve got your own career to worry about, and I don’t even know if I still want to play hockey after graduation, nonetheless with a team in the AHL.” He shrugs lamely, pretty sure Jack probably thinks he’s an idiot.

“There’s nothing wrong with that, Bits. You don’t have to make a decision right away.”

“Well, I’ve got about five days until he wants to know if I accept their offer,” Bitty rubs the back of his neck, cheeks pink.

“Oh. Well, you should let me read the contract anyway, eh? At the very least, it could help you make a decision if the offer isn’t for much.”

“If– I mean, if you want to? That would be real nice.”

“Euh. Tomorrow morning after my run, we’ll look at it.” Jack gives a sharp nod like he’s accomplished something, pats Bitty on the shoulder, and goes back to the game, just as pleased as pie.

\*\*

The win was really something for the Aces, and he gets to meet Swoops, Poots, Scrappy, and Gopher when Kent tells them the baker of the pies is at the game.

“Oh my *God*, I ate like three pieces,” Swoops pats him on the shoulder and laughs.

“I’m so glad you enjoyed it!”

“Oh totally. Gopher can’t help himself around sweets, so you might get a marriage proposal if you aren’t careful.”

“O-oh my! That’s mighty sweet, but I would hate to have to break his poor heart.” Bitty laughs a little and doesn’t notice how Jack’s eyes narrow.

It’s entertaining as all get out when Jack groans at the amount of chirps he’s already gotten for being a Falc instead of an Ace.

“He’s got important...things in Rhode Island,” Kent had finally said to his team, which Bitty did not understand at *all*.

(*But, it does make sense. Jack wants to stay close to Shitty and everyone from Samwell. He couldn’t be part of their nearly everyday lives if he had joined the Aces.*)

They drop by Kent’s house to change clothes, and head out to celebrate the victory with the team, and all that fluttering around his room at the Haus is suddenly worth it when he looks *damn good* in his button-up with a black tank top underneath and a pair of shorts that look like they’ve been painted on his ass.

When he comes downstairs, Kent wolf whistles and Jack gets red in the face.

“Are you sure–” Jack starts, a little stuttery that makes Bitty preen.

“Mister Zimmermann, it’s best you do *not* finish that sentence,” Bitty snipes with his nose in the air.

It’s absolutely satisfying when two very cute boys dance with him at the club, grinding on him and having a heck of a good time.

He doesn’t notice Jack’s sour face until the third or fourth song in, and by then, Kent is making his way through the crowd.

The hand on his arm pulls him out from between two different boys, and Bitty is just about to give whoever it is what for, but Kent just shifts to grip his hips and pulls him in, back-to-chest.

And Lord help him, Kent is an amazing dancer. How does he even get himself into these things?

\*\*

Watching his favorite person, favorite *people*, dance is giving Jack too many Ideas.

He already has plenty when it comes to Bits. Even more when it comes to Kenny since they have history to fall back on, but for Kenny *and* Bits? His brain might shut down because Jack is even *more* invested in that.

(*Kenny hasn’t said anything, but Jack knows him, knows what the look in those eyes means when he watches Bitty. Instead of Kenny trying to talk him into asking Bitty for a date, maybe Jack should be trying to do the same. Or-or talking about if all three of them…?*)

As is, Jack has a lot more thinking to do after this trip.

“I swear I take care of him as much as he lets me,” Jeff is saying, “it’s not like it’s his first year anymore. He’s way past all that, Jack.”

“I know,” Jack downs his beer, tries not to be too irritated at Swoops because of the attitude. Since he and Kenny have been talking again, he knows more about that first year with the Aces and Kenny’s struggles after the Draft than he’d wanted to know at the time. He hadn’t wanted to focus on the difficulties his best friend was having with a new career as a professional athlete, was more concerned about getting himself through rehab.

He’s been finding out about those struggles and bad times, feels better knowing about all the things he’d missed out on back then because that means Kenny is talking to him again.

(*“You cut me out!” Still haunts Jack sometimes when he thinks about how he did that to his best friend, his other half. At the time, it had seemed like a trade he didn’t have any other choice but to make, give up his best friend for the chance to get better.*)

Jeff was the Ace Kenny billeted with his first year, and the two are close. Maybe even closer than Jack and Kenny had been in the Q.

He doesn’t deserve to be jealous of that, but somehow, he still is.

“I did him wrong when he was in the Draft,” Jack finally admits to Swoops, “and I’m glad he had you and the team there when he needed you. I just...I just want to make sure he’s okay. Kenny means a lot to me.”

Swoops raises a brow over the beer he’s drinking. “He was pretty torn up over you that first year, Zimmermann. If I could have, I would have found you and punched you right in the nose for that kid.”

Jack shrugs a shoulder, “would have deserved it.”

“Yeah, yeah you would have,” but it seems like the salt has gone out of Jeff’s spine, and he slumps down in his seat across from Jack. “I had to tell the team not to mention your name for a long time. Not gonna lie, when you got picked for the Falcs, I drove over to his place and stayed the night in case he had a breakdown.”

And *oh* does that hit Jack right in the heart.

“But, he was...not *okay* but okay? He was happy for you, is the point.”

Jack’s heart twists painfully at that, “Euh. He’s a better friend than I deserve.”

“You know, he told me about going to your college, right?”

Jack looks Swoops in the face, thinks he might get a little more clarity about that night of the Epikegster.

“Yeah, he did,” because Jeff can read the *tell me more* on Jack’s face, “and he beat himself up about it for months. Told me he ran off at the mouth because he was angry at you. Hell, you weren’t even happy to see him.”

At the time, no. No, he wasn’t.

“It was...a shock. We both said some pretty harsh things, I think. But, we’ve come a long way since then.”

“I’d say so. He can say your name without looking like he’s going to start crying now at least.”

*Kenny…*

“I’m not going to do that again,” Jack feels like he needs Jeff to know this. “He’s stuck with me this time, eh?”

Swoops laughs and raises his glass for Jack to tap with his own, “here’s hoping, Zimmermann. Here’s hoping. But hey, at least he has someone to help pick-up the pieces.”

\*\*

Kent manages to get them through the throng of people at the bar and get them bottles of water, bracketing Bitty in with his arms to keep people around from jostling them.

They’re both sweaty and panting after the last song, and Bitty doesn’t even *know* how he managed to survive pretty much humping a professional hockey player on the dance floor without embarrassing himself.

“That was so fun,” Kent leans down to talk in his ear since they’re so close to the music, “can we dance some more?”

“Of course we can, honey,” Bitty tilts so he’s talking in Kent’s ear, and it presses them closer together, “but do you need to check in with your team?”

The laugh is low against his neck and Bitty almost, almost shudders.

“My guys are big boys, Bits. They’ll be fine without me mother-henning them to death.”

“Well, all right then, handsome. You’d better get me on out on that dance floor before someone else does!”

And it’s another song or so before they get a slow one. Kent manages to maneuver them into a corner, and pulls Bits in for a slow dance.

“Lord, that was fun,” Bitty doesn’t think much of it, his hands around Kent’s neck. “I don’t think I’ve had this much fun in a while.”

“I’m glad to hear it,” and Kent gives him that big ole’ smile that makes his whole face light up, and Bitty can’t really blame just one bit for just how cute Kent is in that moment. “I’m glad you came with Jack, Bits.”

“Me too. I had reservations with how close we’re getting to playoffs, but I’m glad I could take the time.”

The hands on his hips squeeze once, and Kent’s face falls, his eyes darting away.

Bitty moves a hand from around his neck to his face and turns him right on back. “Hey, what is it? Should we go?”

“N-no, no. I was just–” and Kent looks back at him with a frown, leans in a little to talk quieter. “Do you still hate me? From when I came to your college?”

And *oh*. *Oh my*.

Well, looks like they’re going to have this talk, aren’t they?

“I mean, it’s okay if you do. I was...a dick, okay? I was a complete and total dick. Zimms and I talked about it some, so-so he gets why I said some of the things I said because I mean, he just–and-and I… There’s a lot is all I’m saying. It was awful, not-not all of it, but therapy kind of helps a little? Sometimes it helps I mean, dealing with it when I found him like that, and then later when Big Bob–”

Bitty gently puts a hand over Kent’s mouth to shush him on up.

“Kent, honey,” he tries softly, misses how those eyes get wide above his hand, “I understand how someone can say mean things when feelings are hurt, and it seems like you and Jack have mended fences since then, right?”

Kent nods without dislodging his hand, but his eyes are shiny and just oh, that poor boy. Jack had talked to him about those days back in Quebec with Kent Parson as his right-hand man, and Bitty knows Kent is the one that saved Jack’s life during that overdose. He knows how quiet and strained Jack’s voice gets when he talks about it, can only imagine how terrified Kent had been finding him, performing CPR, getting him to the hospital in Bad Bob Zimmermann’s car.

He can’t touch that painful past for either of them, wishes sometimes he can give that back when he hears how wistful Jack sounds, sees how Kent sometimes looks like he has regrets. No, Bitty can’t fix their past for them, give them back their innocent days, but he can help the people they are in the here and now, can’t he?

“Well, that’s good to hear. What’s really important is that you don’t do that again, all right? Don’t take your anger out on Jack even if he might deserve it sometimes, and don’t ever say those horrible things to him again. Okay?”

Kent blinks at him and his eyes go softly half-mast. He finally nods with Bitty’s hand still over his mouth.

“Good. Then, we’re all fine, right?”

Another nod and a squeeze to his hips.

“Wonderful. Now Mister Parson, we are going to finish this song and then go back to your boys to celebrate. Maybe if we’re lucky, they’ll play ‘Move Your Body’ later because that is one of my *favorites*.” He takes his hand away and grins up at Kent while his heart beats harder at the soft smile looking down on him.

“Good plan, B. If they play it, you can only dance with me, okay?”

“Well, when you put it like that, how can I refuse?”

Sure enough, the DJ plays ‘Move Your Body’ and Bitty is pretty sure Kent’s the one that asked for it. That absolutely doesn’t mean he gives it any less ass shaking than it rightfully deserves.

\*\*

He’s happy to see Jack laughing with Swoops and Poots when they finally tear themselves away from dancing, and Bitty absolutely refuses to drink whatever fruity thing Kent offers him because he’s not twenty-one quite yet, thank-you very much Mister Parson.

But the Aces are so nice when they leave, thanking Bitty again for his victory pies. He waves them off and doesn’t mind Jack’s hand at the small of his back when Kent guides them out.

(Later that night, he pretends he doesn’t hear Jack get up off the couch and walk down the hall to Kent’s room and softly close the door. But at that point, he’s not sure if he’s still a little jealous, or even who he’s really jealous of if he’s honest with himself.)

He eventually gets a few hours of sleep, and still wakes up god-awful early anyhow.

Since he’s been in this kitchen for three days already, he automatically puts on coffee and pulls out what he’s going to need to feed two big hockey players.

He doesn’t even register Kent in the doorway watching him until the first cup of coffee is gone and the second is on the way there.

“Oh my Lord!” He fairly screams when he notices Kent watching.

“Sorry,” is totally unrepentant, the ass.

“You sure look it!” Bitty chirps back after his heart has climbed down out of his throat. “Goodness sakes, were you *trying* to give me a heart attack?”

“Nah, you just look cute in my kitchen, all busy and stuff. I like it.”

And well, that just takes the words right out of his mouth, so he goes back to make sure the bacon doesn’t burn while the quiche cools.

“Bits?!”

Jack is flustered and drenched from the shower, skittering almost right on the ground. He’s only got a towel around his waist and his hair is all over the place.

Bitty can resolutely say it’s the best morning in the history of mornings because that towel is awful short and Jack’s legs are awful long.

“I’m sorry! He just surprised me, we’re fine!” Bitty flaps his hands to shoo Jack out of the doorway. “Go on now and finish your shower. Breakfast is almost ready.”

Jack wipes water out of his eyes from his dripping hair and looks down at him silently.

“I *promise*, Jack. Go on now. Shoo! Naked is for the bathroom and the locker room.”

The slow grin is really just the nail in the coffin because no man should be that beautiful, it’s really not fair to the gay population.

A glance at Kent’s shit-eating grin and he has to silently amend that statement. No men should be this beautiful.

While Jack trucks back down the hall, Bitty grabs paper towels to sop up the water he’d trailed, giving them up to Kent when he gets a frown for trying to clean up.

He tisks to himself and pours Kent a cup of coffee, mixing in the right amounts of cream and sugar, hands it to him when he throws away the wet paper towels.

He puts the bacon on another paper towel to get some of the grease while Kent sits down with his coffee.

“I had so much fun last night. I can’t thank-you enough for taking us.” As he puts the quiche in the middle of the table.

“I had fun, too, B. Most the guys won’t dance no matter what, and you are awesome.”

“You’re not so bad yourself, sugar pie.”

Kent laughs at him, but reaches out to grip Bitty’s wrist before he can go back to the stove, “but, just so I know...you really don’t hate me anymore, right? We’re friends now?”

Oh, this must be the *I need to tell you as Jack’s friend that me and him are datin’* talk. Lord, help him get through this conversation.

“Now, Kent. I already told you last night as long as you don’t hurt Jack like that again and have significantly groveled, we’re all *fine*.”

“Yeah, I know, but I mean, you and me. We’re fine, too, right?”

“Why of course we are.”

“Okay. Okay, good. I just wanted to make sure.”

Bitty pats Kent’s hand with the free one, “and you already know you can talk to me about anything, right? If things like that are bothering you, you can talk them out with me before you go and say something like that again, okay?”

“Yeah. Thanks, Bits.”

“You’re welcome, Kent.”

He retracts his hand with another pat and goes back for the bacon, waiting for the *something else* that might be on Mr. Parson’s mind.

“Bits?”

Mmhm. There is it. “Yes, Kent?”

“You...can call me Kenny, too...I mean, if you want.”

The bacon plate in hand, and Bitty turns to look at the pink cheeks on Kent Parson, the way he doesn’t meet Bitty’s surprised eye.

(*Even with all his team and the press coverage, he’s only ever heard Jack call Kent ‘Kenny.’*)

“All right then, Kenny,” and *oh* is he grinning, thinking about chirping him just for fun. “I think we’re just about ready for breakfast.”

Nothing else comes of it, and Bitty’s not sure if he’s relieved or not.

\*\*

Jack slowly, methodically reads through the scans of the Rebels contract he’s got back at Samwell. Kent reads over his shoulder, eyebrows squinty in concentration.

Lord, they look so cute like that. It’s really surprising no one else has picked up on the dating yet because these two are absolutely transparent.

“So–”

He gets twin *wait a minute* fingers.

“Well fine then,” and he meanders in the kitchen to see if maybe he should make those peppermint cookies after all.

A batch later and both boys come on in and sit at the table with the tablet between them.

Bitty absolutely puts the cookies in the middle and pours glasses of milk. Kent looks from the plate to him with wide eyes.

Two seconds later, he’s already demolishing his third.

*Boys*.

“All right, you two. Give me the low-down.” Bitty waves a hand over his shoulder and starts washing up dishes.

Jack tells him how it seems to be a right fair offer for a rookie hockey player. The money could be better, but well, it ain’t too shabby.

Bitty sighs because the money is utterly *obscene*. More than his scholarship to Samwell for all four years.

Kent has no problem finishing Jack’s thoughts when he trails off, longer in the profession than Jack. He gives more examples of what bad contracts would probably be and makes Bitty wonder if this isn’t his first time helping with these sorts of things.

Well, as Captain of the Aces, he probably has. Not to mention how he babies his rookies.

“So,” Bitty finally bites on his lip, looking down at the tablet, “so if...if I wanted to keep playing hockey after graduation. This is a good opportunity, is what you’re tellin’ me.”

Both Jack and Kent nod at him, serious as a heart attack.

“This is a good opportunity, Bits.”

“But,” Kent looks at him seriously, “we aren’t agents, either. This is from our experience. For a professional opinion, I can suggest some guys, so can Jack, that can haggle the contract for you.”

He stands at the sink with soapy hands braced on the edges, just looking out the window into Kent’s nice backyard.

Kit is lounging on a dishtowel right there on the ledge to get some sun.

And just like his worst tendency, Jack stands up with a cookie and saunters over to stand beside him, back against the counter.

“It’s a lot to take in, bud,” is all growly and soft.

“I never imagined playing hockey after this year,” he admits, “buying a bakery, sure. Learning under other chefs, maybe taking a turn in another culinary art, yes. But, professional hockey? Hell, I couldn’t take a check without passin’ out a few years ago, Jack.”

Jack munches on his cookie, watching Bitty’s profile with soft eyes. “True. But, couple years ago, you wouldn’t have thought you’d end up Captain, and be on your way to the Frozen Four, eh?”

Kent shuffles his feet a little but boosts himself up on the counter beside Jack. “The AHL is like, our version of boot camp, you know? The kiddie pool before you hit the NHL. And there’s a four-season standard for that reason, B. You’ve got four seasons to play your best game and see if the Scouts are interested. I mean, a lot of guys that get a bad break and don’t make it, they can renew their contracts every four years or join the practice teams. Guys that still want to play hockey, like a lot of the guys on the Rebs.”

“That offer is for one season, though.”

“Sure,” Jack fills in, meandering back for another, handing one off to Kent. “It’s a chance to get your feet wet, Bits, see if you can make the first year. I didn’t get a four-year from the Falcs until I got through the probationary period.”

“Lucky they didn’t make you billet, Jack. That’s usually a requirement.”

“Nah, I was old enough. Marty and Tater kept up with me, though. And I had Bits,” Jack shrugs and promises himself this is the last one even as he eyes the full plate.

He glances over at the serious expression on Bitty’s face, thoughts turning behind his eyes because now he’s thinking about it. On one hand, yes, he wants his bud to stay close, be on their sister team’s roster. Pawtucket is only twenty minutes or so from Providence, even closer than Samwell.

(*Jack wouldn’t have to lose him if Bits accepts the offer, keeps playing hockey. Jack thinks he’s terrible for wanting that as much as he does.*)

For Bitty, the eminent future is looking closer and closer as this year draws to a close. Getting this offer was *terrifying* because of all those *what if’s*?

Kent hums around a mouthful, leans around Jack to look at him. “Sure, but you never know, B. You take Samwell to the ECAC, and there might be more people coming to talk to you.”

“Sugar pie, I’ve seen what you and Jack are up against. If there’s one thing I’m absolutely sure of, it’s that I’m not ready for the NHL, no matter how far we go this year. But–” he sighs a little.

“But what, bud?”

“...the real question is, what if I’m not ready to give it up once the season’s over?”

Kent chuckles at him around the last bite, “then you’ll have a year with the Rebels to figure out if you’re done with hockey, or not.”

He catches his breath a little (*could it really be as simple as that?*).

“...that’s what I needed to know, thank-you boys.” He pats Kent on the leg and Jack on the arm, taking up the tablet, swinging right around to go back to the stove and wait for the next batch, hip hitched on the cabinets while he reads all over again.

He’s going to call Coach and Mama when he gets back to Samwell. Then on Monday morning, he’s going to call Mr. McLean and accept the offer.

\*\*

It’s not his fault most the people he’s friends with are so much taller than him.

Really, it’s not.

So when Kent just grabs him up before he and Jack get on the plane and hugs him tight for long minutes, Bitty’s feet dangle off the ground, but he’s pretty much used to it by now. Shitty broke him of it first, Holster helped.

“I’m going to miss you,” is said against his shoulder because he thinks Kent might just be tearing up.

Because of Jack.

Because Jack’s leaving.

Right?

With his feet still dangling, he pats the back of Kent’s head soothingly. “I’ll miss you too, honey. But, it’s not forever, right? We’ll see you again.”

Kent eventually put him down when Jack laid a hand to his shoulder and turned him in for a hug, and Bitty looks away when Kent wraps himself around Jack like an octopus, shoulders shaking just a little.

Jack makes soothing circles on Kent’s back, talks softly in French, and just holds on for a few long minutes. Bitty makes himself busy by checking their luggage tags and slips away to get them some coffee from one of the *twelve* Starbucks in the airport.

A caramel frappuccino helps a little, and Kent just sweeps him on up again.

Jack keeps a hand on the back of Kent’s neck until the very last second, and something in Bitty’s chest tightens a little, but for the very first time, he’s not sure if it’s for Jack touching Kent like that or if it’s for Kent being all upset they’re leaving.

Something to think about another day.

As is, he’s got a thesis to write, a team to take care of, and a pair of professional hockey players that need fresh baked goods. His plate is pretty much full.

## \*\* 4

His vlog has always been somewhere to vent when he needed to, and even if he doesn’t have a *huge* following with millions of subscribers (*yet*), he didn’t think things would turn out this way.

But, the school newspaper he usually ignores puts it right out there for everyone to read.

*Eric Bittle of Samwell’s Own Hockey Team is the First Out Captain in the NCAA*

Dex is there to put a hand on his shoulder when he feels like he suddenly can’t breathe.

Someone watched his vlog and picked up on a few things apparently (*“Never fall for a straight boy.” Those words are going to haunt him forever*).

He’s out to the team, but not the rest of *campus*. Good Lord. Hopefully no one pays it any mind, and they can just ride right along to the next game.

It does not go away.

Instead, the news catches fire, and before he knows it, his face is on ESPN as the first out NCAA captain. The rainbow background isn’t doing him any favors, but in between the panic in his brain, he thinks the yellow of the spectrum looks real nice with those shorts.

Chowder is the one that calls him in to look at the breaking story, looking over the couch to take note of Bitty’s face.

He shows how much his reflexes have improved when he throws himself over the couch and latches on when Bitty’s knees fail and he almost sprawls himself all over the floor.

His phone is in his hand, and Chowder is talking, saying something. He didn’t know when Ollie and Wicks, Dex and Nursey, Tango and Whiskey and Foxtrot, River, Hops, and Louis all got there crowded around him, but he just seems to blink and there they all are.

“I,” he starts loudly, immediately quieting everyone with a single word, “am going to make a pie. Everyone is welcome to hang out while I am doing so.”

So, he makes a pie and while he does, he makes a plan.

He talks out how this could affect the team’s chances of getting to the Championship, how this could affect how they play, how they plan to win the next few games. Bitty thinks it might be smart to step down as captain, being pragmatic as possible now that he’s not panicking about finishing the season and his senior year at Samwell.

Whiskey, who he hadn’t been able to connect with all darn season (*more n’ likely because he found Whiskey at that party kissing the Lax bro*), smashes his fist on the table and says that’s a whole lotta bull. Bitty’s the one that got them this far, and he’ll take them the rest of the way.

(*Bitty still has several talks in the next few days. With the coaching staff, with Samwell administration, with the entire gathered team. He gives all of them the same option. He’ll give up being captain or all out quit the team if this would hurt their changes to go to the Frozen Four. He gets the same denial, loud and belligerent from his whole team –which warms his heart, honestly. They’re all such good boys.*)

They decide to handle it one game at a time, and break for the night. In his room with coppery fear still in the back of his mouth, he holds his phone and stares at the contact information for *Home*.

He’s almost pressed it when a FaceTime request comes from Kent.

Almost at the same time Jack doesn’t bother to knock, but just throws his bedroom door open, looking like he’d run miles.

Throwing himself to his feet, both hands up, he probably looks terrified because Jack scared the absolute *heck* out of him.

“Bits,” and now it’s Jack that’s got both hands up, coming at him, “Bits, it’s okay. It’s okay, bud.” And he really means to say *something*, but he’s just all caught up in Jack. He smells so good and feels so nice, he’s strong when Bitty feels weak and shaky, picking him right on up and sitting down to fold over him like a big Canadian blanket.

“What a horrible way to be outed,” he laughs through the shakes, but his voice is hoarse. “This is absolutely awful, Jack.”

“God, it really is. I’m so sorry this is happening to you, Bits.”

“Lord, I’m making a fool of myself. What’s done is done, I suppose.”

“Still, I want to be here for you.”

“Oh, honey. I appreciate it.”

And he just lets himself sink into Jack a little, burying his face in Jack’s neck, just tries to *breathe*.

His phone goes off again, and this time Jack picks it up, sees who it is, and taps the top of Bitty’s head with it.

He thumbs the request without looking, just keeping his face right where it is. This is the best he’s felt since that awful ticker tape just laid out his biggest secret, and put a big ole’ target right on his back.

“Hi Kenny,” and he’s proud his voice sounds as steady as it does.

“Hey B,” is so soft and concerned, his heart gives a little patter.

Jack holds the phone for him with one hand, and squeezes him tight with the other.

“This sucks *so* hard, B. I’m so sorry ESPN gives a fuck about college sports enough to do something shitty like this.”

He raises his face just enough for Kent to see half his face out of Jack’s bulk. “One of those silly human interest stories, I guess. Too bad they got a little too interested, huh?”

“You can totally sue the shit out of them, okay? B, I *know* a guy. He could get you millions.”

“That won’t make everything right, Kenny, but thank-you for being here with me.” He gives a shuddering sigh, “I’m still going to have to deal with the backlash, and as much as I hate it, so will the team. I haven’t talked to the administration or the coaches, but it might be smart if I step down for the rest of the season, maybe quit outright. Then the boys might still be able to make it to the Frozen Four…”

“You’re *two games away*, B. You can’t give up now!”

“Agree. You got them here, they’ll have your back, Bits.”

“Kenny, Jack this is hockey. Everyone we go against from here on out is going to be gunning for us. The things they’re going to say to the boys–”

“They’ll handle it. Trust me,” Jack soothes, “they won’t let you give up either.”

“Well, I suppose we’ll see come Monday,” he’s tired, but there’s no slowing down right now, even if Kent is petting Kit and Jack’s lap is absurdly comfortable.

“Besides,” Kent continues, “you’re not alone, B. Plenty of us in the NHL. We’re just not like, *out out*. Maybe to our teams and stuff, not like, outed on ESPN or anything, fuck those guys. You *seriously* don’t want me to contact my guy for you? He got 6.8 million dollars for a celebrity case–”

“So you’re out to your team then, Captain Parson?” He blinks because the way Kent just came out with it, not a stutter one, shakes him.

“Huh? Well, yeah, of course I am. I’ve been on the Aces for years, Bits. These guys are like my family, so yeah, they know.”

“O-oh.”

Kent blinks at him, pauses. “Ah, I didn’t come right out and tell you, but yeah. Me too, so it’s okay, B. You’re not alone.”

It’s that moment when Jack leans down, shifting so Bitty’s looking up at him. “You’re not alone,” Jack repeats softly, “I kiss boys sometimes, too. None of that changes how good you are at hockey, and none of that changes *you*, okay Bits?”

And Lord above *help him*. He throws both arms around Jack, biting his lower lip between his teeth, and shaking like a leaf in a wind storm.

“Jack...Kenny…thank-you, boys. Just when I need you, and there you are.” He chokes a little, and there’s Jack folding down around him, there’s Kent holding Kit closer to the phone, sending virtual purrs and cuddles.

He doesn’t feel that bad wrapping his legs around Jack’s waist shamelessly, locking his ankles in the back, and just not facing the world for a while.

It gets a little better when Jack tries to squeeze into a pair of his shorts while Kenny is brushing his teeth and talking about the camp they had at a local rink, running drills and plays with some of the high school kids from around the area.

But everything in the world absolutely pauses when Jack clears his throat awkwardly

And really, God Bless Canada.

The little sigh that comes out of him is echoed from his phone, and yes Kenny, they do have good taste.

“I can’t sleep in these, Bits, ah, sorry.”

But that color blue stretched taunt against Jack’s big thigh is just the best sight he’s probably ever seen.

“I’m sorry, but that’s all I’ve got to offer. I can go talk to Dex?” Because Chowder has wider shoulders like Jack, but is about a foot shorter.

“Eh, not necessary.”

And well, *yes*. Bitty knows Jack wears cute little briefs. They were on a team together, have spent time in the locker room, have seen the occasional moment before towels go on. It’s men’s sports for crying out loud.

But none of that, absolutely *none of that*, prepares him for Jack shimmying out of those shorts for black briefs that absolutely *mold* to his behind and cup the front of him. The real *coup de gras* is that t-shirt coming off, and heaven help him, it’s muscles for *miles*.

Only those little briefs between Bitty and what the Good Lord gave Jack, the definition of *fine* walking across the room like butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth.

Bitty unabashedly watches, lips parted, cheeks a soft shade of pink.

Jack closes the bathroom door, smirking where Bits can’t see, muffled noises as he roots around in the bathroom for a spare toothbrush. It gives Bitty just a second to himself to take in this whole situation.

- He’s been outed on a national sports network that may or may not take the question of the Rebels right out of the equation
- Chances of going all the way to the finals is looking slimmer and slimmer the more he thinks about it
- Jack and Kenny confirmed some of his suspicions and it’s an absolute *crime* and a blessing that they’ve found each other again
- Jack has gotten bulkier than Bitty realized in the last year and a half playing for the NHL and his ass should be marked as a dangerous weapon
- He hasn’t answered any of the phone calls from home
- Still, Coach sent him a text, *Call your mother. She’s worried about you*.

<!-- -->

And top of *the list*, Jack Zimmermann is in his bathroom, shirtless, barefoot, after *just* having verbally come out to him.

If there was ever anyone that deserves to be up for Sainthood, it’s this good ole’ Georgia boy Right. Here.

With his head in his hands, he groans softly, and scurries to throw on his own sleep clothes, stripping down without a thought more than those short on Jack and those shorts *off* Jack.

“I absolutely feel you,” a breathy chirp, and *he forgot Kenny probably saw the entire thing*.

Bitty spins, almost ready to start getting on a boat down that river called *denial* when he realizes Kenny is giving him the most devilish looking smile.

“It’s really unfair that he’s a hockey God and blisteringly hot to boot.”

“We are the best of *friends*, I’ll have you know Mister Parson. Jack doesn’t even see me that way, even after tonight. Besides, I’m pretty sure he’s got his eye set on someone prettier than little ole’ *me*.”

He throws the covers back to busy his hands, but can spare a second to put some charm into it and look back at Kenny with a wink.

It’s either the best or the worst timing because Kenny gets this *look* on his face, opening his mouth for something that might have been good or bad, when Jack comes out of the bathroom smelling like mint and looking like a touch could burn you down to the ground.

Kenny looks at him for a few long seconds while they’re climbing into bed, and chirps them about *hands above the comforter* and *hockey bros cuddle like champs* before he yawns and finally hangs up for the night.

The sheet gets maneuvered between them so he’s not going to be tortured most of the night with only his sleep shirt and pants between them–

(*and those sinful underwear, he’s never going to forget those*)

–so it’s suspiciously easy to drop off with Jack’s arm around him and snoring in his ear.

\*\*

The next two games are utterly *brutal*.

Ice bags are wrapped around his shoulder while he sits in his spot in the locker room, forearms on his knees to just hurt while Chowder is talking at his right and Dex at his left.

The bruises tomorrow are going to be beautiful, but heck, what’s some bruises when Samwell is officially *in* the Frozen Four.

Lord, they *made it*.

And he will start celebrating, right after he can raise up his arm again.

Oh, that’s going to be sore tomorrow. Making pies for the campus captain club is going to be *awful*, isn’t it?

He manages to get the ice bags off in time to walk with the boys back to the Haus, Ollie already scooping up his bag and Chowder, bless his heart, hovering anxiously right by him the whole walk there.

They don’t make him do a keg stand this time, thank goodness, but the party celebrating their win is well underway in less than an hour.

It’s real nice when the Lax bros bring in a stack of pizzas and slap him on the back in congratulations, like he hadn’t just been outed on national television. (*He loves Samwell so much*.) Chad L. says a whole bunch of something that Bitty tries to follow and ends up handing him a plate with pizza and accepting a piece of pie in exchange.

The fire extinguisher is in plain sight to remind the footballers what could happen if they don’t behave, and at least two of his boys hang around him most the night, bracketing him on both sides to keep an eye on him. Ollie and Wicks pop around the corner periodically anyhow.

He catches Chowder taking a picture for social media, has a second of panic, almost tells his sweet son not to do that because everyone *knows*, but shuts his mouth last minute and straightens up to grin for the next one.

\*\*

The night the news came out, Bitty changed his social media to private, hoping to avoid some of the homophobic comments. Since the morning after (*and it’s a crying shame he missed seeing those little black briefs again since Jack was already dressed by the time he got up*), he’s been talking to pretty much everyone.

Most of all, his Mama and Coach...and Mr. McLean.

Jack squeezes his hand, and Bitty bites his lip, but still, “I’m afraid I don’t think I should accept your offer after all. This isn’t going to blow over any time soon.”

“Mr. Bittle. I’m interested because you’re fast, you’ve got soft hand, and you’re a good fit for the Rebels. As far as I understand, this isn’t going to change any of that.”

“O-oh!”

“If you want to play hockey, Mr. Bittle, you can do that with us.”

And it’s there when he looks in Jack’s blue, blue eyes, when he thinks about Ollie and Wicks, when he thinks about Shitty being so kind when he’d come out to the first person on the team. It’s there when he thinks about being terrified at that first check practice, when he thinks about how dang far he’s come in four years.

(*It’s tough, but you’re tougher.*)

“I want to play hockey, Mr. McLean.”

“That’s the spirit Mr. Bittle. I’ll send you training camp information in the next week or so. Welcome to the Pawtucket Rebels.”

If Jack holds him tight while he almost shakes apart once he hangs up the phone, well, only Chowder and Dex will ever tell a soul because they fell on him and Jack like a ton of bricks, hugging him and laughing.

\*\*

Shitty, Ranson, Holster, and Lardo make the trip from Boston to show up on the Haus doorstep before they’ve even finished clean-up from the party the night before.

Before he knows it, he’s got Shitty crying all over him, telling him he’s so *proud* and Bitty’s just the best little captain there ever was.

It’s so nice because Shitty is silly as hell, but he’s an amazing friend in times of need.

And he can’t say it isn’t nice when Shitty picks up the loud speaker and starts shooing the rest of the hanger-oners out.

“Frozen Four!” Ransom crows, “our guys are going to kick some *ass*.”

“You said it, bro,” Holster warmly pats Bitty on the shoulder with one of those big hands while this pie is just coming along easily enough.

The flinch when the bruises ache is enough for more ice bags to get wrapped around him, and Shitty to shake a finger in his face, talking about taking care of himself. It might not be a concussion, but they’ve got serious games coming up, and he needs to be tip top if he’s going to take them all the way.

Bitty takes it to heart and lets them baby him for a few hours.

It does get worse when Dex and Chowder see Holster pulling the neck of his shirt up a little to check how bad it is, and then he’s got more hockey players in his kitchen butting in. Luckily, Dex is getting just as good at making pie as Bitty, and finishes up the lattice work *perfectly*.

He talks strategy with Ransom and Holster at the kitchen table while Lardo makes another pot of coffee, and Chowder subtly slips the bottle of ibuprofen next to him. Whiskey listens to them strategize for the upcoming games, and my, don’t it feel so *normal*.

He hugs Shitty again, holds on just as tight as he can, and thanks the Good Lord for such amazing friends.

\*\*

Mama and Coach are more understanding than he ever would have imagined, taken in account what a shock it is just to come across the television like that.

“Dickey, honey, now you know,” and she has to pause because *Lord*, his Mama is crying, “you know you can always come *home*. Always. No matter what. We *love you*. We love you and everything else, we can figure all that out.”

And so, since he’s never said it, only thought about what could happen, he tells her, “Mama… I’m gay.”

“I know, sweetheart. I know and that’s-that’s fine. We can figure it all out. But, you can come home sometime before the semester ends, can’t you?”

“N-not while we’re close to the Championships, Mama. I-I can’t–”

“Junior.”

And now he’s glad he just called instead of trying to FaceTime. So glad he doesn’t have to look Coach in the face right now.

“You’ve done a heck of a job this year. Been a good captain. You know me and your mama are proud, don’t you Junior?”

And there goes his lip all trembling, his eyes getting hot. Only Jack squeezing his hand keeps him together at all.

“Y-yes, Daddy.”

“Good. You just keep fighting. We’ll be here cheering you on, all right?”

His breath hitches in his chest, “yes, Daddy.”

“That’s my boy. You can do it, Junior. They’re tough–”

“–but I’m tougher,” and he’s covering his eyes, shoulder hunching down. Jack goes from holding his hand to pretty much lifting him up enough to slide on Jack’s lap.

“That’s right, son. You sure as hell are.”

He sighs out, a soft noise. “I am, Daddy. We made the Frozen Four.”

“Go get ‘im. Me and your Mama are behind you all the way.”

And even if Coach gets squicky when it’s time for *I love you*, Bitty manages to get it out anyhow.

“Love you too, son. Now you gotta stop, or else your mama’s gonna drown me.”

The thick laugh is so much better than crying. Jack thinks so too apparently, squeezing tight while Bitty’s sitting on his thighs.

If he thinks there’s a kiss pressed to the top of his head, well, he’s just going to blame it on being emotionally overwrought and leave it at that.

\*\*

He didn’t bother with pads, just pants, sweatshirt, gloves, stick, helmet, and skates. The ice is quiet as can be in the morning light bouncing off Faber, making it beautiful.

Kenny’s far enough ahead of them that he’s on a break from practice, already home making brunch. “Big Red is going to be killer, B. Cornell is ruthless. Fighting Hawks from North Dakota.”

His skates cut through the ice until he’s gliding, hitting the long stretch, pumping as fast as his legs can take him, cycling the puck.

He doesn’t reply to Kenny, just listens while his muscles burn, his mind works, he sees the next move like a playbook.

Over the past four years, he’s gotten stronger, faster. Sure, he’s smaller than the average hockey player, but that don’t mean *weak*. Everyone they’ve played already figured that one out now didn’t they?

His arms and shoulders burn when he swings high, throws some muscle in it when he slaps the puck right in the sweet spot of the net.

“No *fair*, B. I want to watch!”

“I’d have to set my phone in the stands, sugar pie.”

“If that means I get to watch you do suicides, I’m on board.”

Bitty laughs out loud because *Lord*, he sounds like Jack.

“Trying to kill me before practice?”

“Captain’s prerogative, babe.”

Obligingly, Bitty sets up his helmet, laying on it’s side, throws a t-shirt in it to hold the phone up, and FaceTimes Kenny.

He gives the captain of the Aces a wink and then takes off to the blue line. He’s got his game face on, stick balanced perfectly, moving like his ass is on *fire*.

After a good turn out, he skates back to the stands where Kenny is very close to the screen.

“Well, there you go, Captain,” he snickers, scooping up the whole thing so Kent goes around the rink for some easy, cool-down laps with him before the boys start meandering in for practice. “That what you wanted to see?”

“You? Are *fast*, B. That was incredible.”

“Oh, sugar pie,” he grins down at Kent’s face in his helmet, “you say the nicest things.”

“Hey, I’m not being nice, Bits. I’m saying as a professional hockey player that you? Are fast.”

“Well, so are you. Short guys like us have a tendency to out-maneuver the big guys.”

“I’ve based most of my career on being the fast guy on the team, B, but I don’t know how I’d hold up against you.”

“Mmhm. I also haven’t been playing professionally for the last few years, tearing the fire out of my knee, Kent.” Very serious because he’s counted how many nights he’s seen ice bags over that knee in the last few weeks.

“Also true. It might be surgery for me this summer, but that should do a lot. I’ll have maybe ten years instead of five.”

“So you said. Your doctor is talking about it again?”

“...yeah. He says it should do wonders for where I’m at right now, and this might be the year to just do it and get it over with.”

“Three-time Stanley Cup winner is where you’re at right now, sugar pie.”

The laugh is nice, but now he’s wondering if he can convince Kenny to come to Providence and stay with Jack during his recovery. That’ll let Bitty be close enough to come over and take care of him while his knee heals. He’s already thinking it over when his third lap is coming up.

“B.” Startles him right out of his thoughts.

“Kenny?”

And something is there in the way Kenny is looking at him from the screen. “Be careful at the game tonight. Watch out for the Minnesota D-Men, okay?”

“Thank-you, sugar. You watch on out for those Rangers.”

“I will. Just send me a text when the game is over, even if I’m in overtime, okay?”

“You know it, honey. Now go on and get a nap. We’ve both got a busy night tonight.”

\*\*

This could be the last time he steps out on the ice. This could be it. All of it could end right here right now.

They’ve got to play their hearts out. He’s got to give it everything he’s got. For himself, for the boys, for Samwell.

It comes down to this, facing Minnesota’s line like there ain’t no going back.

\*\*

He sits on his bed, *faggot* and *fairy* in his head from the game earlier. He doesn’t accept Jack’s call because his face is a *mess*.

Well, serves him right because Jack just shows up at the Haus an hour later when Bitty has finally got it together.

\*\*

The check is absolutely *brutal*.

He used to be floored by it, curled up in a little ball on the ice, couldn’t move, couldn’t think, could barely *breathe*.

But not this damn time. Oh *hell no*.

It’s fast when he’s back up on his feet, shoving his way through bigger men than him and stealing that puck right on out from under them.

He feels like he’s got wings on his feet when he glides by them like they’re just standing still.

\*\*

Mama and Coach are here because they’ve come down to the last stand.

This is it.

Jack and Kenny are both there and where in the *world* they got #15 Bittle jerseys, he will never know.

Number #82 has already been gunning for him, but the last one is the very last of Eric Bittle’s patience running right on *out*.

His heart is racing, his legs burning, skates cutting ice as he steers around players, gritting his teeth against the ache, and for the first time, he’s gonna stand up, holler out that *no*, he’s not gonna take that nonsense lying down.

The moment slows down for long enough that he feels weightless when he pushes off, is airborn, shoving all his weight right into #82 just as they’re at the Samwell bench and shove the both of them right in with the boys.

It’s a tangle of arms and legs and skates and sputtering.

“Try me again, asshole,” Bitty sneers in #82’s face with the face guards the only thing between them.

“Homophobic prick!” One of his boys shouts.

Coach and the boys pick him up (*shocked because he doesn’t usually have a need for potty mouth thank-you very much*), want him to go get checked out while the ref blows the whistle just after Whiskey gets the puck, and now it’s all on Samwell.

He doesn’t get a penalty, thank goodness, and argues loudly with Coach to let him back in the game, he *needs* to get back. It’s not like he lost a tooth, just some scratches from going over. It’s a long look in his eyes before Coach just throws up his hands and shoos him back.

And Bitty’s not thinking about Jack and Kenny and Shitty and Lardo and Ransom and Holster and Mama and Daddy and everyone else up in those stands screaming for them when he hits the ice again. He’s not thinking about how badly he hurts or the scratches on his face. He’s not thinking about his thesis or graduation or his spot in Jack’s guest room.

He’s only thinking about the tied score, the next play, and how they’re going to show these away boys exactly who’s house *this is*.

\*\*

And his arms strain when his stick comes back, when he slams that puck with every ounce of strength he has left. His heart thuds hard in the back of his mouth when their goalie’s hand shoots out, tries to catch the puck, just the tips of his gloves skimming the surface.

The alarm blares and the scoreboard changes so fast, Bitty’s not really sure what happened until his boys slam into him, gather all around him, *screaming*.

He’s dazed, fingers limply holding his stick, eyes still stuck on the scoreboard even when they lift him up, stick and all.

The crowd takes to the ice, and he gets his helmet off in time to get hugs from Mama and Coach, in time to accept the huge trophy, him and Coach and Dex holding it up with all the boys around them just a hooting and a hollering all over the place.

Ransom and Holster catch him right up off his feet, crying all over him when they tell him how proud they are.

The interviews shake him out of the daze and he tells the viewers at home that the team fought hard for this and earned it all themselves. He’s proud to be their teammate and captain, he’s proud to be a Wellie, and darn it, their hard work paid off.

Just as he turns, sees Chowder going past with three of their guys behind him, singing the Samwell song at the top of their lungs, he catches Jack and Kenny standing on the ice by the boards, watching him with soft smiles on their faces, and his eyes get hot abruptly, get full as can be.

Center ice, just like with the Stanley Cup. And this ain’t that now. This? This one is all his.

He feels his lower lip tremble just a little, puts his hand up to stop it, but dang it if Jack and Kenny aren’t just easing across the ice toward him with those smiles and his name across the back of their shoulders.

He gets a hand on the back of his neck and a shoulder to hide his face while the whooping and celebrating gets loud, loud, loud.

Lord, he’s going to vlog the *hell* out of this tomorrow.

\*\*

Shitty is naked.

While it’s not new (they’ve been to Haus 2.0, and yes, Shitty was naked there too. Good times, really), Bitty has always had reservations about him being skin-to-fabric on that dang couch. Who knows what he might get. Well, all that spilled tub juice probably goes a long way to sanitize. Or so he says to keep his revolution to a minimum.

Watching Kenny get his ass handed to him from Lardo is hilarious. Watching Jack give in and have a chugging competition is even *better*.

He’s lucky the ECAC playoffs beat the NHL by almost a month. Jack and Kenny have another week before they start getting *serious*.

Ransom and Holster are talking animatedly with the Waffles, back slaps all around. He’s pleased as can be when Shruti, Sharon, Edgar, Chad L., and some other captains drop by to say congratulations and have a piece of pie. He doesn’t see Jack pause over his shoulder while he talks up a storm, doesn’t see the considering look on Jack’s face.

Something about this Bitty hits him harder than the last four years, makes that perpetual tightness in his chest mean something completely different than anxiety.

He should have realized it long before his graduation, should have been terrified of it all happening again.

Bitty affects him in so many of the same ways Kenny does, and it’s an amazing yet terrifying thing for Jack Zimmermann. Feeling like this person you’re looking at is literally made for you.

And just as he starts taking a step forward, pushing himself in to stand at Bitty’s side like he’s done the majority of their friendship, Kenny ducks out of nowhere and takes him by both biceps. His expression is *desperate*.

“You’ve *got to stop her.* Zimms. Zimms, be on my team. Right now.”

It’s so absurd because it’s *Kenny* and also because he knows no one is beating Lardo.

Ever.

Anything else is wishful thinking.

He casts a wistful look at Bitty, animated with his big win, and if Jack literally has his heart in his eyes until they’re out of sight, then only Chad L. from would have seen it.

\*\*

Later on after the captains have said good night and some of their...*guests* have started staggering out, cheering for Samwell, for hockey, for tub juice, and for pie.

For this one, Bits really couldn’t take credit because Dex really made most of them, bless his heart.

Moving around the party-goers with a spare trash bag to pick up a bit, he spots someone sneaking upstairs, pauses to squint up in case he needs to charge on up there and firmly remind people the upstairs is off limits.

Or break out the fire extinguisher.

Either way.

...but he knows that ass in those jeans, and gasps softly as Jack’s plaid is bouncing up the steps ahead of Kenny.

And, he can let out a sigh, catch just a little bit of bittersweet. But, if there is anything Eric Richard Bittle prides himself on, it’s being a good friend. If Jack and Kenny needed a-a wingman or whatever, then he’s just going to dang well be that.

He keeps an eye on the stairs for the rest of the night for more than one reason. No one, *no one*, is going to disturb them when they’ve finally come this far, and even if he silently dreads it, hopes they at least used his room instead of a bathroom for heaven’s sake.

## \*\* 5

His utter and rightfully earned *outrage* at Betsy II being unplugged is *through the roof*. The Haus might as well just fall around their ears.

Any time now.

But, the *Finish Your Fucking Thesis* party sponsored by his team was literally his saving grace, and with all those texts and emails he’d sent to Jack over the last few weeks, he’s able to pull off a real nice effort.

Foxtrot checks it for citations. Nursey for his sources, Chowder for grammar and mechanics because sometimes he’s awful at things like that. Dex is standing there keeping everyone quiet when they’re in the living room so Bitty can concentrate.

Ollie and Wicks join him at the kitchen table with their laptops, making it a joint effort even though both of them have been done for ages.

Whiskey hangs around on the outskirts, talking to everyone, but staying out of the way.

Hops, River, and Louis are watching in utter *horror* at what’s lying in wait for them. All-in-all, it’s as much as the team as possible wandering around the first and second floor, floating in and out as Dex plugs Betsy II back in to have mercy on Bits when he literally needs pie to *live*.

(Dex bakes without even thinking about it now. He’s been fully converted.)

Jack and Kenny have started their playoff beards and special training sessions. The roadies are going to be brutal for the next month or so, and Bitty doesn’t bother them nearly as much as he wants. He gets Skype sessions, short and sweet, but still nice that they’re thinking of him.

And it’s all winding down now, the time when he’s going to need to pack his things and get ready to leave looming over his shoulders.

But training camp for the Rebels starts in September, and he’s going to need to find a place in Pawtucket before graduation, purchase a car, put the electric in his name, get settled before he starts this next step–

*Lord, four years have already come and gone, and how it breaks his heart to have to go.*

\*\*

When he talks to Shitty, Shitty talks to Lardo, Lardo talks to Ransom, and Ransom talks to Holster. Holster talks to Chowder and Chowder talks to Dex and Nursey. Dex talks to the Waffles while taking down some *study for your finals* pie.

Before he knows it, there’s two cars full of people ready to ride down to Pawtucket and look at apartments with him so he doesn’t have to go it alone. He may have been teary-eyed about it, but held on to his dignity and made sure both cars had plenty of snacks.

He switched cars half-way through, not wanting to get in on the speculation of who would be next year’s captain with the Waffles and the Frogs. Besides, nothing against his boys, but this whole trip just reminds him he’s closer to Shitty, Lardo, Ransom, and Holster (*and Jack*) than his teammates.

\*\*

It’s a two-story duplex, the realtor tells them while the Waffles are *oohing* and *ahing* over it, checking out the large master bath and quaint balcony. The kitchen is a *dream* and he can already see what color curtains he’d have for the windows. He takes pictures and selfies, imagines a nicer couch than that green one, and maybe a coffee theme for the dish towels. Closet is big enough for even *his* amazing wardrobe and a special place for his hockey gear. It has a nice guest room with an adjoining bath, comfortable kitchen big enough for a table, and a gas fireplace in the living room.

He listens to the realtor gossip on about the owners next door only coming for vacation one week a year or so, which means he’d be pretty much living without next door neighbors. That makes him a little lonely to think about, but the street past the fence is hustling with quaint local businesses he’s itching to explore. Lardo spotted the antique store before he did and they vowed to stop after this appointment.

He thinks about how close to the rink it is and what a nice neighborhood it seems to be. He thinks about how quaint it is and how excited he is to have furniture that doesn’t stink of incalculable kegsters.

After doing the math and still overwhelmed at how much he signed with the Rebels for, he shakes the lady’s hand and takes a copy of the renter’s agreement to complete and email back in a few days to get the process started. He makes a mental note to call around for utilities once he’s done with the last final he’ll ever have to take, and laughs at everyone cheering when he tells them this is the one.

“Haus 4.0! Fucking *right, *Bits! Have you even *seen* how great the tub is?! We’ll make tub juice for days!”

It’s about half an hour from Jack, so he’ll see everyone just as often. And that makes all of this a little easier to swallow. A little bit of change while everything almost stays the same.

Eric Bittle thinks this is one hell of a way to start.

\*\*

Coach and Mama come up a few days before graduation. He gets them a nice hotel room to stay because Lord, he wouldn’t have them at the Haus.

They give him good advice and go with him to the bank so he can set up a money-market account for some of that big ole’ paycheck.

He takes them to look at the empty apartment with only a few of his boxes in the bedroom. He’d already picked out the furniture he wanted and it should be delivered in a week or so.

Mama cries and hugs him, telling him he’s so grown up now, her son graduating college. They go with him to look at a car, and he tells Coach with how bad the winters can get, he probably wants to stick with a truck.

He doesn’t get a *newnew* Chevrolet because his parents raised him to appreciate money, but he gets something that runs real fine, something *oldnew*.

They see Jack and give him big hugs, sit close to him during graduation.

And when Bitty is up there in front of everyone with Ollie and Wicks grinning at him, wearing their helmets too, he starts talking about what Samwell means to him, how it gave him the future, how it made him the person he is right now, how it gave something to everybody.

It’s not until then he can find the strength to look at the future as moving *forward* instead of *moving on*.

\*\*

The crowd around him is massive and pictures all around. Ollie and Wicks pound him on the back, say they’re proud to be on his team this year, Bits, you did good. Mama gets a picture of Jack picking him right on up with Lardo and Shitty on one side, Ransom and Holster on the other, the Waffles and Frogs dressed up nice all around them.

He can tell Dex is going to be just fine because he reigns everyone in without thinking about it.

And unfortunately, he doesn’t get time like he did at Jack’s graduation. He only gets a few minutes pulled aside while Coach talks to the boys about next season, and Mama still calls Shitty “Mr. Crappy” while he rails on about Harvard.

But in those few minutes, Jack is smiling down at him all soft and gentle.

“I’m so proud of you, Bits,” low between them, Jack wrapping around him, and he feels so good and warm, smells so nice. “You’ve done so much. Such a good job, bud.”

“Thank-you, Jack. I probably wouldn’t have made it this far without you, you know.”

“Doubt it. You’re the kind of guy that’ll fight through the bad to get to the good, and you won’t give up until you get there.”

“Oh Jack,” Bitty sighs, squeezing Jack’s massive shoulders. His eyes get a little heavy and hot, but it’s better because Jack presses him tighter too.

\*\*

Mama and Coach fly back to Georgia the day after graduation.

“Now I want you to call at *least* once a week, Dickie, especially when the furniture gets here and you can do that thing on Facebook where I can see the room–”

He smiles because he loves her so much. “It’s a video call on Facebook Messenger, Mother.”

“Yes, yes, whatever it is. And I am just dying to see how you fix it all up!”

“It’s going to be amazing.”

“I know, honey,” and she gives him another of those hard, close hugs only a mama can give, just enough not to squeeze your lungs out through your mouth. “I’m so proud of you, Dickie. So *proud* of you, baby.”

And dang it, Mama. Now he’s hugging back just as hard with tears in his eyes. “Thank-you, Ma’am. I love you, too.”

And Coach finally faces him when they’re all done being weepy willows together, and his Daddy is smiling under his mustache, and his eyes are all soft. They hug just as tight, Coach sighing against him.

“You done good things, and I’m right proud to say–” Daddy’s breath hitches, and here we go with the water works again “–that this man right here is my *son*. And when...when you bring your-your, uh?”

Daddy pulls him back just a minute, frowning in confusion. “Is it boyfriend? Partner? What do we call your man, Junior?”

Well, shut his mouth. “Boyfriend, Daddy.” And now he’s trying to wipe his eyes around the hug.

“Oh. Well, when you bring your...boyfriend on home, he’ll be welcome to stay–”

“In the *guest room*,” Mama hurries to break in, “he will be welcome to stay in the guest room. Isn’t that right, Richard?”

“Oh, well, you heard your mother, Junior. He’ll be welcome to stay in the guest room.”

Mama gives an encouraging nod.

“But, *Mama!*”

“Now Dickie when two people are-are *involved* but not married, it’s not proper–”

“*Involved?!*”

And if he doesn’t love them with every inch of his heart.

\*\*

He’s at the Haus for another few days, waiting for his furniture to be delivered to his new apartment in Pawtucket. The Waffles are gone on home for the summer, and only Dex is staying but he’s gone home for a week to work on the family fishing boat. By then, Bitty will be gone, moved in. His room will be empty, but heck, Whiskey’s not even going to start moving in until August.

But, everyone else gave Shitty, Lardo, Ransom, and Holster leave to stay in their rooms to keep Bitty company while he packs the last of his things up. So really, it’s all come in this crazy kind of full circle, all of them out in the yard drinking beer, watching awful movies, sneaking in the rink for his very last time on the ice.

How crazy is it that Ransom and Holster bring their old jerseys, Shitty and Jack too. He’s not crying while they’re in Faber at dawn, messing around, living their *best* lives.

Lord, if it doesn’t make his heart ache in the best ways.

They go with him when he dons a kerchief and spends a few hours in his new place to clean it from top to bottom before the furniture gets there the next day. Ransom and Holster ride in the bed of the truck even though Bitty frets he might get pulled over.

Shitty and Lardo ride in the front with him and FaceTime Jack when they get close to Providence.

He’s washing down walls while Lardo goes to Target for a vacuum and other supplies he forgot. Ransom and Holster tackle the bathrooms, bemoaning how beautiful the tub is, Shitty checks the microwave, refrigerator, and oven, then generally keeps everyone company between things he finds to do.

Oh, there’s the electric panel. Thanks, Shitty.

The man is literally tightening screws in the overhead fans for goodness sake. Where did he even get a ladder?

Where did he get tools?

These are the same kind of mysteries that made the Haus what it was.

Jack comes up when they’re finishing up for the day, whistles when Shitty lets him in, and Bitty is *covered* in dust and dirt.

Jack laughs at him and wipes a smudge on his face with a thumb.

The housewarming gift he brought is a *massive* television, a flat screen that is literally bigger than Bitty is tall.

“Oh Jack, I can’t accept this,” he frets, looking over the box so big Jack had to put down his back seat just to get it in his SUV!

“Sure you can. I’ll be over to use it, too, eh? It’s for both of us.”

Which is when Bitty thinks of it still in his pocket, and reaches out for Jack’s sleeve to get his attention before the others come down to help heft this thing in the house.

“Bits?”

And there he is staring up at Jack’s blue, blue eyes, and the heart of him just warms right up when Jack is smiling at him like that.

This boy, now.

“Well, I just wanted you to have this–” and he opens his palm, an extra key right there, “–in case you ever need to get in, or you know, for emergencies.”

“Oh,” is soft, and Jack’s smile turns into a face-splitting grin. “I get a key to your place, Bits?”

“Well, I have a key to yours! And-and if you ever need anything or need to get in, you’ll already have it, right?”

“Yeah, yeah, that’s right, bud. Thanks,” and Jack’s fingers are warm when he takes the key out of Bitty’s hand, pulls out his ring to go ahead and put it right on, showing it off before putting his keys back in his pocket.

He’s still all smiles and sighs, “Bits, you know–”

Is interrupted when Shitty, Ransom, and Holster burst out his front door and see the massive dang thing they’re going to need to carry upstairs.

“Cable man is coming on Thursday,” he rambles on while the boys carry that big ole thing, “electricity, gas, and water are already on. Trash is set-up. Thank goodness this place has a gas stove, I swear I cannot cook for much on an electric at all.”

He orders pizza, and runs out long enough to pick-up enough beer and drinks since the place isn’t ready for pie making just yet. He’ll plan a better grocery store trip once the furniture is settled.

They sit on the floor eating pizza, watching some Spanish channel the boys were able to get somehow and talking about September when the training camp would start.

Like he expects, Jack is the one that directed the conversation there while Shitty is trying to get them to play flip cup on the counters.

“Parse is coming to visit next week,” Jack tells him to the side when everyone is totally bowing down to Lardo. “He wants to see you. I got a little ice time at the Falcs, so we can gang up on him.”

And while the one side of him hurts a little, the rest of him leaps when Jack says Kenny is coming to town.

“Oh no! Jack, this place won’t be ready in time!” He surveys with hands on his hips, already distressed with what Kenny will think. And *oh*, if he brings Kit, they’ll need a cat tree! And little dishes for food. He can get just a few cans at the big commercial grocery store close to the house, and goodness, he doesn’t even have a spare bed, just an inflatable mattress, and there’s no way he’s going to ask two Stanley Cup winners to share a worn-out blow up.

(*Though they might like that idea anyway. Maybe he will offer it after all.*

*He is not going to think about offering them to share his bed with him.*

*Much*.)

Jack ruffles his hair, big hand lingering on the back of his neck, “He doesn’t care about all that, Bits. He cares about seeing you.”

Bitty goes a little red in the face, but he can’t help be pleased as pie just hearing Jack say so.

“And he wants *food*, Jack. Do you think I rolled off the turnip truck yesterday? Hm, that might be a nice way to christen the kitchen though. My boys need their snacks.”

He doesn’t really think when he says it, instead imagines his kitchen utensils unpacked, making a plan on how to feed his people in thanks for helping him with all this growing up. It’s the least he can do.

(And doesn’t notice Jack’s brows raise and his face to split into a big smile.)

After some thought and a few rounds of flip cup, Bitty tells everyone they can go back to the Haus or whatnot, but he’s probably going to stay the night since the furniture is coming tomorrow anyway.

Ransom is *appalled* he’s going to sleep on the floor with a measly blanket and pillow by himself in his new place.

Jack mitigates by inviting everyone to stay the night in Providence instead so they can all be there to help with the furniture tomorrow anyhow. That and he’s got plenty of space for everybody.

“Oh! They’ll be people to move it in, so y’all won’t have to–!”

“More hands make less work,” Jack chirps shamelessly, “besides, you helped me get my place arranged. I owe you one.”

“We’re best friends, Jack! You don’t owe me a darn thing.”

“I could call Tater to come help. He’d do just about anything to make sure we keep getting Nook Pies.”

“For heaven’s sake, like I won’t still be sending pies.”

“And jam?”

He smacks Jack right on the chest.“I do not half-ass *anything*, Jack, and I’m not about to start now.”

\*\*

Ransom and Holster get the living room pullout couches, Lardo and Shitty get the guest room. No one says a word when Jack steers him to the big bedroom, puts too big shorts and t-shirt in Bitty’s hands, and points him at the shower.

It’s their luck Jack has an abundance of Falcs shirts for everyone. Lardo is *adorable* in Jack’s running shorts while their clothes wash.

When everyone is bleary, staring at the television, and the cleaning-up is done (*because Bitty cannot sleep if there’s a mess in the kitchen, it goes against everything he’s ever been taught*), Jack herds people to bed, still the captain, really. He gets Shitty up on his feet, pretty much carrying him down the hall with Lardo laughing like hell behind them. He tucks in Holster who’s already snoozing away, and gives Ransom a clap on the back for good-night.

Since he’d already grabbed Bitty’s extra toothbrush from the guest room bathroom, Bitty’s brushing away in Jack’s, eyes not even open. Jack’s hand on his back doesn’t even startle him, just lets his feet carry him to the bed where Jack flops the blankets over him.

He might hear Jack talking low in the bathroom while he brushes his teeth, but sometime later, he realizes the mattress dips as that bigger body climbs on in beside him. He doesn’t register that Jack's bed is much bigger than his little ole’ full, so they don’t have to be all squished together, just sighs in contentment when an arm comes around his waist and a chest presses into his back.

Then, he’s out like a light.

\*\*

Jack is an absolute sadist that makes him get up God-awful early to run.

“Professional athlete now, Bits. Up n’ at ‘em, eh?”

Bitty notes that he doesn’t wake Shitty, Ransom, or Holster, just leaves them snoring away.

After they take turns in the shower, Bitty’s got breakfast on for everyone finally waking up, drinking his own coffee like it’s manna from heaven.

He talks about running down early to go grocery shopping and unpacking a box in the kitchen before the movers get there, and waves them all off when they want to make a run of it.

(*Lord, he knows how they are in a supermarket. Taking all of them to WalMart is an all day trip*.)

They can all fit in Jack’s SUV if Lardo sits in the middle in the back.

So he’s off in his oldnew truck, biting with excitement on shopping for his first ever apartment.

It probably takes longer than it should have, but he just needs so *much*.

He’s still in the middle of figuring out where he wants to put things when the group of them arrive, and it’s unpacking his kitchen supplies so he can make a pie and christen the kitchen as *home*.

(*He’s thankful his Mama brought up a box of her old curtains, sheets, and other things he’s going to need*. *She is truly his hero.*)

By the time the movers come with furniture for the living room and both bedrooms, the scent of apple and cinnamon is just perfect.

He’s laughing at Ransom and Holster treating the furniture arrangement like a crucial job, chirping back and forth, fiddles around to find the comforters he bought for the new beds and mattresses, starts the washing machine up to get them on so he’s got clean sheets.

He putters around putting the clothes he’s brought in bureau drawers, putting up his things on the walls while Jack meanders in and out to check on him.

The nice movers love the pie and thank him profusely for sending one with them.

\*\*

Saying good-bye to them...makes him a weepy willow. Of course, he knows they’ll make trips just like he and Jack do. He *knows* they’ll be Skypes and FaceTimes, texts, social media chirping, and just all the usual. He knows that the only things changing here is he doesn’t live in the Haus anymore. He’s not walking halls, running to practice, hanging out in the Quad, getting to Faber before dawn hits.

He’s just like the rest of them now, moving on and moving forward.

So when he starts tearing up when Shitty’s beater pulls away from the curb, Lardo hanging half out the window to blow kisses, Holster’s fist raised up in a sign of solidarity, Ransom wiping his messy face because he’s just as bad as Bitty, now isn’t he?

Shitty’s laughter and the blaring music fade softly away as they get further down the road, and soon to the interstate where summer is in full bloom.

He doesn’t realize he’s leaned forward the further away they get, hand over his heart, tears running down his face.

Until Jack’s big palm settles gently on the nape of his neck, fingers wrapping around, rubbing soothing circles.

And Bitty looks up at those gentle eyes, the soft, sad smile on Jack’s face. It’s sympathy and empathy, an understanding at how it is to *let go*.

And however it happens, however they came to be clinging to one another, holding on *tight*, Bitty’s face buried in Jack’s chest, gripping his t-shirt with both fists, those long arms wrapping him all up, Bitty still *needs* this comfort, needs Jack so much it plain ole’ hurts.

It’s so nice when Jack makes him lock up his place, takes them both back down to Providence, keeping him talking about every little thing so he doesn’t think about being sad anymore.

They pick-up dinner, and he’s snuggled up on one of Jack’s comfy couches, toes peeping out from the too-long pajama pants. Being a bad influence because he’s making Jack break his diet and eat ice cream straight from the carton.

They watch awful television instead of hockey tapes, but still chirp each other when necessary. Bitty keeps to hot chocolate while Jack has a few beers, lounging back, head turned to look while they go on about something or other.

“Besides–” is followed by a massive yawn, “–you’re going to start Rookie camp, Dex is going to come back and be lost as a lamb, and Kenny’s coming to visit. We’ll make the trip to Vegas after camp, eh?”

And well, Jack always has a way of changing the perspective now doesn’t he?

“I suppose it’s going to be a busy summer,” he mumbles back, a deep sigh making his chest rise.

“Mmhm. Not to mention when you’re gonna show up at the Falcs. You’re a Rebel now, so Tater’s gonna want ice time.”

He starts listing until he’s practically laying against Jack’s side. “I didn’t think about that.”

Jack hums again, “sure enough. Plenty to keep you moving, bud. Don’t worry.”

Later, when he’s brushing his teeth wearily in Jack’s bathroom, pretty much steered there with the expectation he’d be sleeping in Jack’s bed instead of the Guest Room, he tries not to think about crying in his cornflakes now that he has to be an adult, but tries to be happy about Kenny coming down next week instead, about talking Dex through his first few weeks as team captain, about starting his career as a professional hockey player.

With Jack next to him in the mirror, he realizes this is about as good as it gets.

## \*\* 7

Kenny is a sight for sore eyes.

*Lord, *he’s a pretty man.

Bitty drives him and Jack to the airport to pick Kenny on up in the oldnew truck, chomping at the bit to see him, already has a nice peach pie waiting, hopes he brought Kit this time. Jack laughs at him as he prattles on, happy as a clam.

Kenny runs at them, already laughing, and launches himself at both of them. “Hey! There’s my guys!”

Bitty laughs with him and throws an arm around his waist, pulls Kenny in against him and Jack.

“C’mon! Get me out of here. I want to hear all about everything!”

Jack picks Kenny’s bag right off his shoulder, carries it while they wait at the luggage rack for the bigger suitcase and hockey bag. Bitty doesn’t mind a bit, wheeling one behind them while Kenny talks and talks between them.

He’s animated and happy, and Bitty’s happy seeing him like this, is happy seeing the gentle look on Jack’s face whenever he looks at Kenny. They’re just too much sometimes.

But, it’s lucky Bitty drove so he’s got things to occupy himself, putting down the tailgate, lifting up the bags in the back while Kenny grabs his bicep and whistles.

“Ooh, getting ready for camp, Bits?”

Kenny wants to see his new place (probably because he knows one Eric R. Bittle by now, and is fully aware there’s pie or other sweets *somewhere*), and hopes they can have some ice time before he has to go back to Las Vegas.

They pile in the truck, Kenny shuffling in the back seat so he and Jack aren’t squished. He leans on the seat while they talk about everything, miles eaten up under the tires. He doesn’t think Kenny’s been in Pawtucket, so he takes the route through town before they get to Bitty’s new place.

The pie on the counter is just a *welcome*. Still, Kenny makes grabby hands, snatching up the perfectly peach pie the minute Bitty tells him it’s all for him.

“Cookies are in the freezer, but those go back with you,” he makes coffee while Kenny snuggles up to that pie, and Jack chirps him down to the ground.

“Don’t judge me, Zimms. You get Bitty pie all the time!”

“Only in moderation, bud.”

“Sure, sure. Keep telling yourself that.”

And there they go, bickering like an old married couple. He thinks it’s absolutely adorable, and his heart gives little pitter-patters for them.

For lunch, he makes a simple chicken and rice, puts plates in front of his boys while they’re still talking and catching up, chirping one another good-naturedly, and *Lord* the UST is thick in the air.

He loves how Kenny takes the first bite, all distracted, and has to stop, look down at the plate and shove another bite in his mouth.

“This is great, B!”

“Why, thank-you, sugar pie. The recipe is on my vlog if you ever want to make it.” Bitty winks at him and takes a bite off his own plate.

“Vlog, huh?”

And they’re off and running about his baking and cooking, talking with him about the one where Jack and Tater were trying to make cookies, and the rest of the afternoon they spend watching some of his YouTube videos.

Kenny drops off the second video in, jet lag probably finally catching up to him.

Bitty turns the sound down and whisper-asks Jack if he can help out. Jack’s face gets a little pink, but he stands up by the sleeping captain, bends down to slide both arms around Kenny and lift him up easily like he’s not a full grown man.

The sight of Jack holding him up like that is soft and sweet, just like the expression on Jack’s face when he looks down at Kenny laying against him, just adorable while he snoozes away. It works like a charm, and Bitty’s smug as can be when he turns down the sheets in his bed since he doesn’t have a guest one yet, just that inflatable mattress, and helps Jack ease Kenny down, pulling his shoes off and tucking the blankets back over him.

He and Jack sneak back with an exchanged smile and tiptoe out.

\*\*

Bitty gets to the dishes while Jack puts the leftovers in tupperwear, and sets one aside to take home since Bitty knows Jack loves his chicken and rice.

(“*Jack, just follow the instructions on YouTube!”*

*“I do. It never tastes as good.”*

*“Well, for heaven's sake. I’ll make it *for you *whenever you want, you know that.”*

*“That’s what I want to hear, bud.”*)

“You’ll have to take him back to your place to stay,” Bitty is saying apologetically, “the bed for the guest room won’t be here for another few days, and I’m not gonna let you or Kenny sleep on that awful air mattress.”

Jack starts to dry the dishes and put them away. “He’s had worse, Bits. Especially when we were in the Q. Air mattress or a couch won’t kill him.”

“Jaques Laurent Zimmermann. I am so disappointed in your hosting capabilities! Kenny is your *friend*.”

“Euh. Doesn’t mean he can’t sleep on your couch.”

“There’s no reason for that when you have a perfectly nice guest room and bed at your place.”

Jack pauses beside him, looks pointedly at him until he’s looking back, and the expression makes Bitty *curious*. It looks like Jack is strategizing, assessing, just like on the ice.

“You going to bed with me then, Eric?”

*What?*

He blinks up at Jack uncomprehendingly, trying not to think about how his name rolls out of Jack’s mouth like that when he also says *going to bed with me*.

It’s so much worse when Jack leans down closer, talking in a deeper voice that-that sounds awfully sinful, “If Kenny’s in the guest room, you’ll have to sleep with me. I can’t have you on the couch either. That wouldn’t be right.”

For a moment, the tension between them, the ones that makes Bitty’s cheeks get pink for no apparent reason, makes his eyes stray down to Jack’s mouth, further down to his hands, makes something low in Bitty’s stomach tight.

When he has to swallow, remembers Kenny is literally *in his bedroom right now*, he has to stop this utter nonsense. He’s trying to get them together after all.

“W-Well, it’s not different than all those times after you moved out of the Haus, or-or I can just stay here.” He takes the smallest of steps back, retreating, biting down on his lip to make himself turn away from Jack and hide his trembly hand in some dishwater.

Jack doesn’t move for a second too long, but when he finally does, the tension eases back, and it feels like Bitty can get a little less breathy when he’s less aware of how big and muscley Jack is, how his lower lip is pouty, how strong his hands are--

“Yeah, we’ll see how that goes when he wakes up.” just shrugs, back to putting plates away

“As long as it doesn’t include killing his back on a crappy, college air mattress, I’m sure he’ll be fine, sweetpea.”

He’s washing up the pan and doesn’t see Jack’s small smile.

\*

He picks up his stick and an extra along with a ball after the dishes are done and waves Jack outside with a hand. He’s betting on hockey to help him clear out the remaining fog Jack managed to cause in his mind.

They take a little bit moving all over Bitty’s patio, slapping the ball into the side of the building, moving around each other for a while. Jack admits he has no idea what to do with Kenny other than take him out to eat or out on the ice.

Bitty keeps watching the ball for his turn, hitting it wide so Jack can use his ridiculously long arms to reach.

“Seriously, Jack? He loves movies, especially those sappy rom-coms, he loves dancing and museums, he likes antique stores, animal shelters obviously–”

“I’m not getting a pet,” Jack deadpans.

“That doesn’t mean you can’t take him down to volunteer for the day,” Bitty counters. “But that silly movie he’s been wanting to see is out now, so you should make a plan to take him to see it.” And *oh*, Bitty is *good* because he can picture it now: Jack and Kenny in a dark theater, eating popcorn, laughing softly at one another. And then, half-way through the movie, Jack is going to do one of those silly stretches and lay his arm on the back of Kenny’s chair, and even before the movie ends, when it’s still dark in the theater, they’re going to have a moment where they look at each other and–

“Bits? Bitty?” Jack waves a hand in front of his face.

“Oh! Oh sorry,” and his face must be *red*, “I was just thinking about something. What did you say?”

Jack is tossing the ball up in the air now since he managed to catch it before it hit Bitty in the face. “I said why don’t you come with us to see a movie?”

*Boy, don’t you know what I’m trying to do for you? Not a romantic bone in his body, I swear.*

Bitty sighs and faces him, expression serious, “Jack,” he warningly waves a finger, “you and Kenny need to spend some quality *time* together. Now I know he’s got his team in Las Vegas and his life there, but he hasn’t seen you since the championship game! He’s probably missed the fire out of you!”

Jack’s eyebrows draw together, lips pursing like he’s trying to figure something out, and Bitty just sighs at him because he’s so hopeless. Honestly.

“You should make it a boy’s night out! Go see a movie, go out to eat, maybe dancing? Kenny loves to dance, you know. Show him a night on the town.” He gives Jack’s arm a few encouraging pats.

“Oh. You think he’d want to?”

*Hook. Line. Sinker*. Because Jack is looking up at the sky, that pensive look, eyebrows slightly squinky.

“Well, sure! He’ll have you, won’t he?” And Bitty winks at him, trying to get the message across. He gets back on track, holding his stick again, “all right, Mister, let’s get on with it so you can go plan your d-...boy’s night.”

Jack doesn’t catch the almost slip, and obligingly leads Bitty away from the wall and to the patio where they can work. Off skates, Bitty’s still smaller with less reach and Jack is still a giant, but they manage to wrangle around and hit a few in the crappy goal Bitty’s got in the backyard.

They’re out long enough that Kenny wanders outside, the sun catching him in the perfect light, eyes still sleepy and hair mussed.

“What?” Is utterly outraged and adorable, “playing street hockey and you guys didn’t wake me?!”

“Aw now, don’t get all upset Sleeping Beauty,” Bitty chirps with a grin.

“I thought they called that the Walking Dead,” Jack’s robot voice, but he’s grinning from ear to ear.

Kenny’s offended squawk makes Bitty bust out in giggles.

“I’ll show *you* Walking Dead, Zimms!”

The laughing doesn’t stop until much later.

\*

The Falcs Arena is bigger than Faber, and Bitty’s been there numerous times cheering Jack on, even skated here on family days, met the Falcs, and of course, brought Nook Pies. But today, he gets to come out on the ice, just his helmet, gloves, and stick to horse around a little bit. He’s got his name across his shoulders and takes a moment to think again about his last night at Faber with the team, kissing the ice and taking it all in. The memory makes him smile a little.

It’s insane to think he’s going to be on the ice with Jack and Kenny together, even with Tater since the big guy is already here, but, well. He’s got a new step to prepare for, his next move into the world of professional hockey, so he’d better start either start putting up or shutting up as Coach would say.

Jack and Kenny are talking up Tater on the bench, still lacing skates, so Bitty just takes off, getting in some warm-up laps to get his legs ready. He bends down, staying low, trying to get his speed on, cutting it close enough to skim the tips of his gloves over the ice. On a pass by, he gets a puck, skates backwards just a little bit of stick work while he’s moving.

He feels more than sees Kenny, turns it around so the Captain of the Aces can race with him. He wouldn’t admit how big he’s grinning when he passes the puck without looking, and Kenny just scoops it on up, gliding next to him, working it out to warm up a little, too.

He isn’t shocked when the puck is just suddenly in front of him, and he’s turning quick and easy, taking off down the rink, controlling the puck, keeping his speed, dodging both Tater and just barely missing Jack, but the head fake got him going the wrong way.

He’s not laughing.

Much.

His slapshot is good enough to take the question out of *is he ready to play in the AHL? *Thank-you very much.

His Samwell jersey flips and flutters when he swings it wide.

Kenny snatches him up stick and all, “damn, you *are* fast! I *love* it, B. Make me work for it.”

“Well, it’s the only thing I got going for me, sugar pie,” he grins back, laughing at those wide eyes.

Kenny arches an eyebrow at him behind the face mask. “Nah, that’s not all,” and sets him back on his skates.

Something about the way Kenny says it makes his stomach flip.

But then Jack’s hollering for them while Bitty’s face gets red, and he moves to get the puck out of the net. “Looks like two-on-two,” Kenny is hollering back when they meet up at center ice. “I’m taking–”

“Me and Tater versus you two, right?” because Bitty (*knows they need to do this, to be a team on the ice again, help them heal just a little more and move on from that awful game last year*) is already giving Tater a glove bump, listening to his second favorite Falc talk about that video on his lamb and how good it turned out.

“Mwah, is *masterpiece*. So tender, very good, Itty Bitty.”

“Aw, honey. I’m so glad you didn’t burn it dry as the desert. Good job!”

But he does see the way Jack straightens on his skates, turns to Kenny, and the trepidation is right there. But then Kenny looks right on back, and the two of them seem to get it together, closing ranks.

(*He is giving himself the best friend of the year award and no one is going to convince him otherwise.*)

He grins at Tater, takes the big hand on his shoulder while he’s mentally patting his own self right on the back.

\*

He has no idea how in the world it happened.

One minute he’s rushing Jack and Kenny with Tater right on his heels, sees the two of them move, the puck–

It’s a fancy side move when he’s able to slide right in between them and catch the puck on his way through, snapping it to Tater once he’s left Kenny and Jack in the dust.

It doesn’t hit him until he’s close to their goal and Tater passes, gives Bitty a chance to make a solid one right in the net. But when he pauses to realize what he just did, he turns to look at where the others are staring right back at him.

*He literally just foiled the Parson-Zimmermann-no-look-one-timer*. *Dang it all to heck! *

“Top Cheddar, bud,” Jack lays a glove on his head and winks, “putting on a show for the Rebels already?”

He laughs but it’s a little off. He’s pretty well shocked at himself, and kind of disgruntled he might have screwed up what could have been a nice moment for those two.

“Well, can’t let you boys have all the fun, now can I?”

It’s not until later when they’re all leaving Falc’s arena, chirping one another, that Eric R. Bittle has quite the realization.

“Goodness, *no*,” he’s waving Kenny away, tossing his bag in the back of the truck. “I’ve got to get some things done at the house. I’ve only been moved in for a week or so, you know. But, you two go right along and make a nice night of it.”

“But, *B!*” Kenny whines, arms coming around him, nuzzling into his neck, “I’m only here for a few days!”

And Bitty just pats him soothingly, looking at Jack with a grin at the antics of this boy.

“I know, sugar pie, and I will see you tomorrow with fresh goodies to take to your team. How does that sound?”

Kenny sighs, laying all over him, “sounds good, I guess.” But he pulls off *petulant* like a champ.

“Of course it does,” he soothes, “now you go on and get yourself all dolled up and make Jack take you some place nice.”

“Aww, Bits. What’s wrong with our usual place?” Jack pouting should really be a crime.

“It’s a sports bar, honey, and Kenny is a *classy* fella.” The chirp is even better because Kenny puts a hand on the back of the truck and strikes a pose. “You two should go a little more upscale,” and he’s patting Jack’s arm, too. And this, Internet Land, is where planning and research come into play. He makes his voice nonchalant, “maybe something close to that Museum of Natural History? They have a planetarium, and there’s a neat show on tonight around ten.”

Because Eric Bittle might not be dating anyone right now, but he sure as hell can *plan* one for his best friends. He’d already done the research, has about four more suggestions right on the tip of his tongue.

But just like he thought, Kenny straightens up, “there’s a Natural History museum? With a planetarium??”

Bitty gives no mind looking at Jack as smugly as he can possibly can.

And, well, Jack’s a softie at heart, not to mention the pleading look Kenny is giving him right now is downright criminal.

“Yeah, bud, that does sound like a good time,” and oh do his eyes go soft when Kenny’s face lights up.

“All right! You two have a real nice evening ahead of you, and I have goodies to make and a video to plan.”

“Okay, Bits. I’ll text you.”

“Don’t make any videos without me, B. I want to be in the next one!”

His put-upon sigh should be loud enough to hear all the way down the street. “Lord, I already see a food fight happening because you two in one place means nothing but trouble.”

“What?! Really??” And Kenny grabs on to Jack’s wrist, wiggling with energy, “*Ja-ack*! Bitty said we can have a food fight in his video!”

“*Now you wait just a minute, Mister. My kitchen is not a hockey rink!*”

He finally waves them off to Jack’s big SUV and pulls himself out of the parking lot, whistling at a job well done.

He thinks about how cute it is that Kenny is going to have the best time watching the show with Jack, looking up at the stars, his eyes all soft and gentle. He thinks about how good it is they all have a break for the summer so they can go down to Las Vegas before training camp starts, and he can be here with them as much as possible.

He thinks about how he’s going to make Swoops and Gopher their main favorites but might make Scrappy different kinds of macaroons this time.

He thinks about laying on Jack’s couch with both his boys curled around him, watching television or chirping each other when things get boring.

He thinks about how much them being happy, being able to be together means to him, and how much better it would be if all three of them could–could…

Oh.

Oh *no*.

“*Never fall for a straight boy*” used to haunt him. Looks like that’s going to change. But, “*Never fall for your best friend’s boyfriend,*” really doesn’t sound any better, now does it?

\*\*

Sometimes when he’s having a crisis, he calls Shitty.

This time, he needs–

“Lardo,” he wails, utterly *torn*.

“Okay, Bits, okay, hold on,” he hears her muffled talking and then movement. Something squeaks and shifts, then she’s back. “I am all yours, Mr. Bittle. What’s the emergency?”

“I…” and his heart beats in the back of his mouth, “I think I’m falling for my secret crush’s boyfriend.”

It sounds utterly absurd because Jack is more than just a crush, always has been, but if he’s going to be able to talk about this with someone more sensible than he is when it comes to this kind of stuff, then he’s got to throw Lardo off the scent at least a little.

(*If she ever found out it was Jack, he’d never live down the chirping. Not to even mention if she accidentally said something *in front of Jack* and-and. Just the thought of losing Jack, his friendship, his hugs, his smile, his hockey robot talk, late night calls because of “Anxiety Brain,” all of it, all things that are just Jack. All of that being gone from his life is enough to make his eyes hot and heavy.*)

Lardo is silent for about five seconds.

“Since when does Jack have a boyfriend?”

“*What*? Who said it-it was Jack! I’ve gotten over all that, no. I said my *secret* crush. I’ve never told y’all because you’re awful people. I am only breaking my silence now because I am *desperate*. I need help.”

She makes a noise over the phone that might have been a squeak. “I mean, you’re not wrong. We are horrible people, and we enjoy it. I can also probably guarantee Shitty and I would have chirped you, but Ransom and Holster would have probably set up the date of your dreams, made plans for you to confess your undying love or something.”

“*Lardo*.”

“I’m very serious. But you have a secret crush? The last guy you were hung up on was Jack, and from what we saw, that really hasn’t changed. Now, I’m hearing there’s a new man, so you can’t blame me for being curious.”

He is absolutely *not* going to address her ‘from what we saw’ comment. Not. At. All. “W-Well, I finally got it through my head Jack doesn’t see me that way, and we are going to stay the best of friends. As it should be, you know?”

“Oh, Bitty,” and there’s her sympathy for his obvious dilemma, “it’s so cute you really think that. But, okay, I’ll leave it alone. Maybe Shitty will want to tackle that. Or, Ransom and Holster might want to make a PowerPoint– you know what, we’ll have a house meeting about it. Anyway, so there’s a new guy in your life. A potential crush, I might add, and you are pretty sure…?”

“I like his boyfriend.”

“Hm. So, you like him *and* his boyfriend?”

His voice catches in his throat, staring out at the back yard, biting down on his lip.

“Yeah, you do. You want to be the peanut butter and jelly between those pieces of bread, huh?”

It’s awful how once she said it, Eric Bittle can’t put the idea back in the box.

(*His face goes red so fast he thinks he might pass out from the blood rushing to two places in his body at once*.)

“No,” he whispers, “no, no, I would die. I would die of hotness. They would bury me with Betsy the first, *Here Lies Eric Bittle, he burned alive because those two are scorching hot*.”

“Whew, not just a crush, but a very *hot* crush.” She pauses again while Bitty is dying a very slow death in his nice, sunny kitchen. “Are you *sure* you’re not talking about Jack?”

“Jack is unbelievably hot, but no. Not Jack,” but his voice is thready and weak, he might be wheezing a little because to look up at Kenny grinning behind him and Jack in front of him…

“That sounds really hard, Bitty, I’m sorry.” And she sounds like it, good old Lardo. “But, you know what I’m going to tell you, right?”

He has to stop thinking about this. Right now or he’s going to embarrass himself.

Deep breath. Stop thinking about all the ways three people can have sex. That isn’t helping.

“You would tell me if the feelings are strong enough, go for it. Talk to them.”

“Indeedy-do. How strongly do you feel for this multi-person crush, Bitty?”

He thinks about Jack, about summer in Madison, and his name on the back of those shoulders, about car rides and cooking, about talking him down when it’s been a bad day or night and the pills don’t help enough, about standing beside him, beside *them*, about the Stanley Cup and snuggling in bed, of moving furniture and making his favorites when he makes for the team and–

“Not strongly enough to mess up what he’s got going,” pops right out of his mouth, but is really a revelation.

He can’t do anything to mess up what they have, what he’s watched them fight to get back. He can’t do that, and he won’t. He’s going to get this nonsense out of his head and try to be Team Pimms all the way.

He can do this for them.

Lardo sighs at him, “can you keep being their friend if you feel this way, Bitty? It’s going to be hard, you know?”

Well, it was hard with Jack for a while, too. It might be tough, but Bitty is tougher.

“It is,” he admits quietly, watching the birds drop down and dig for worms, “but, it’s not worth losing them, either.”

“Mmm. Figure it out, Bitty?”

And he has to take in a deep breath and close his eyes, steady himself. This is why he called Lardo instead of Shitty.

“Yeah, I did. Thanks, Lardo.”

He consoles himself a little with the fact he’s playing for the AHL might help pave a way for Jack and Kenny in the long run, so someday, maybe they can come out together. They won’t have to hide.

It’s nice to think that is something he can possibly do for them.

Bitty hangs up the phone feeling better. The pressure is still there in his chest and the images are still there in the back of his mind where he’s banished them, but the possibility of breaking what he has is enough to make them just nice thoughts.

And there’s no harm in that.

## \*\* 8

Once he feels better about things, he starts baking. He’s had peppermint cookie dough made, just needs to bake it on up. He gets pecans and walnuts chopped up, gets fruit ready for pie filling, gets the right dough out for something else.

It’s late when he finishes up his plans for the day, counter littered with the proof, a fresh notebook page filled with ideas for the next video waiting for Saturday.

By now, he’s lying on his couch with a blanket and Senior Bun, watching something but his eyes keep closing.

He wakes up at close to midnight, phone buzzing with incoming FaceTime from Kenny.

Even though he’s nearly out cold, he fiddles with the icon until both Kenny and Jack are grinning at him from outside the Planetarium.

*Lord, they are cute*, he thinks sleepily, not moving a muscle snuggled under his blanket.

“Aw, B. No, no, no. You’ll get a crick in your neck if you sleep on the couch.” Kenny chirps at him while they’re walking through the parking lot.

“S’okay. M’ comfortable. Didja have a good time?”

Kenny holds his phone up so Jack can smile and talk in the camera, “it was really cool, Bits. Wish you would have come.”

“Mmhm, next time,” he waves away with a yawn, “got my projects done, so I’m happy.”

“Aww, you made Kenny more pie, didn’t you?” And yes, that’s Jack chirping him too.

Well, for heaven’s sake.

“I make you pies all the time. You can’t begrudge Kenny, Jack. That’s mean.”

“Yeah, Zimms! Don’t be *mean*.” But Kenny is grinning all wide and white.

And Lord, the mischief in Jack’s eyes when he looks down at Kenny just about makes Bitty’s heart turn over.

But then Jack’s looking back at the camera. “Like I’m going to believe you only made him a pie, bud? We’ve met, you know.”

“Alright Mr. Smarty Pants,” and now he’s sitting up, rubbing his eyes blearily. “When I said *projects*, that’s what I meant.”

Kenny has to pause, gasping at how fucking *adorable* B is sitting up with the blanket drooping off his shoulders, sleepy-eyed and mussed.

(*He’s probably sleep-warm. Perfect to snuggle. Damn it. Now he wants Bitty snuggles.*)

Jack’s attention is right on the image, smiling at Bitty’s puppy yawn, all sloe-eyed and dopey. Both of them are adorable, Kenny sighs to himself, and it isn’t fair Jack refuses to ask Bitty out on a date because they would be so good together.

(*Even though it might kill him a little because, you know, they're kind of, in a totally non-skeevy kind of way, beautiful people totally made for each other. But, Kent Parson is secure in the fact he would still get snuggle times, Skypes, meet-ups, and hockey even if Jack and Bitty get it together and realize it someday.*)

“I will rightfully kiss your oven for its wonderful delights soon. We’re leaving now,” Kenny jumps into the passenger side of Jack’s SUV, “then we’re stopping to get pizza. Jack ordered it while we were still in the show, so it should be ready. We’ll see you in about--” he raises his brow at Jack.

“Twenty?”

“Okay, twenty minutes, B.”

“Pizza?” Is a little blearily, and Bitty gets immediately grumpy, “Jack! I thought I told you to take him to a *fancy* dinner!”

Jack shrugs a shoulder carelessly without looking away from the road, “nah, we’ll do that tomorrow night when you can come too.”

He literally has to pull the cover over his head to facepalm because *why* is this boy so clueless? Matchmaking should not be this difficult. Even in the worst of MooMaw’s sappy Lifetime Movies, one of the oblivious parties comes to their senses with some meddling from well-meaning friends and/or family, and it’s a happy ending from there. But he needs to get his boys on an actual *date* to make the magic happen.

After that talk with Lardo, he’s decided. Plan Pimms is a go.

“All right then,” he yawns and stretches, “I’ll try to wake up enough to eat your darn pizza.”

“And give me pie,” Kenny stipulates.

“And give you pie,” there’s another yawn, and he’s more blanket than face.

“Aw, bud. You can go back to sleep–” but Jack sounds all sad about it. “We’ll just...go back to Providence I guess. Pizza might be cold–”

“–and no pie,” Kenny whimpers mournfully.

When he dares to peek out of the blanket, he sees the reflection of the red traffic light they’re stopped at just before he gets a load of those *puppy eyes*.

In that moment, Eric Bittle knows he’s a weak, weak man.

“I know exactly what you two are doing,” but he still throws off the blanket and lays Senior Bun down in the pile, “and that won’t work on me. Not at all. I just absolutely *detest* wasting good pie.”

He picks up the phone and misses the smirk Jack and Kenny trade in the car.

\*\*

He has no clue how he ended up laying against Jack with Kenny between his legs, face in the crook of his neck, and Lord they feel good and warm and comfortable laying on his couch with the pizza box still open on his coffee table. The television is on with the *are you still watching?* message on in the dark room.

He has no idea how the lights got turned off, and he reaches for his phone without waking Jack or Kenny. Not close enough to morning that he has to wake up. He can very easily go back to sleep and wake up this way again if he really wants.

The cuddles are wonderful, but he steels himself because anything past this? Would be a complete and utter disaster.

(*His poor heart couldn’t take it, not if they break him on accident. Isn’t it enough he’s helping get them together?*)

He manages to get himself out from between those two without waking them, but just by the skin of his teeth.

He has to do the old rock and slide to ease out from under Kenny, sliding the bigger hockey player right in the crook of Jack’s body. Kenny’s face nuzzles against Jack’s neck, his body lifting in a sigh before he’s right back out, and Bitty is left standing there, looking down at them with his throat suddenly tight at the picture they make.

His heart gives a little throb of want, a painful moment when that secret wish, that small, forbidden fantasy he never lets himself get too lost in, the one with these two just like this in his bed, waiting on him to join them. If he was brave, thinking about all the signs to be what he thinks it *could* mean, he could risk so much. So, *so* much if he just leans in and presses his mouth to Jack’s...and then Kenny’s.

His face warms up when he looks at Jack’s sleeping face, the tempting space on the back of Kenny’s neck, and catches his breath.

But then, common sense kicks in.

*Lord, what is he even thinking?*

The bed is cold against him, but he’s not getting up until he hears them up and moving in the morning.

He sleepily thinks how he’s going to beg off going to Vegas later in the summer. After waking up that way, there’s no way he’d survive if it happened again.

\*\*

With the resolve of someone invested in Moomaw’s “stories,” Bitty makes every effort to slyly push his two best friends into dates and cute couple-y moments for the next two days, tries to give them every opportunity to be alone, even when they’re helping him in the kitchen.

(They help him film his next blog video, and *yes*, that food fight happens, even with all his effort to stop it. But, honestly, watching Kenny and Jack laying all over one another on his formerly clean linoleum, covered in flour and eggs, laughing like they’re just kids again, and his heart is in his throat at how their eyes sparkle, how they chirp at one another with soft tones and wipe off baking supplies with such gentle touches.

He keeps the original video with those precious fifteen minutes.)

The only problem is–

– they keep making him come along, and just *dang it*.

He must have been *awful* in a former life because everything about them is utterly precious to him, and helping them see how good they are together makes *him* see how good they all are. You know, all three of them.

His nerves are about a wreck by the time they’re taking Kenny back to their airport, laden with so many goodies he had to get another suitcase to pack full.

(To be completely *fair* and all, they did help with a few batches before and after the Great Food Fight. All must serve penance for tomfoolery in his kitchen. It’s Number #2 on the Kitchen Commandments list on his fridge.)

And even as he’s looking up at Kenny all smiles and sunshine, he already knows he’s got to have a really good reason to back out of the Vegas trip after Rookie Week, or he’s going to be calling Lardo, crying all over again.

Eventually, he’s going to mess up somehow, especially when they’re both right here within reach.

He sure doesn’t think about how much it’s going to hurt, putting just a little distance at times now, even if it’s really to protect himself and them at the same time. He sure doesn’t feel that little throb in his chest while Jack talks animatedly about hockey and Kenny and the plans for the summer and strategies for next season while he drives them back to Providence.

When he realizes how quiet Bitty is being, Jack reaches over to squeeze his hand.

“I miss him, too, bud. Don’t worry, we’ll see him before the end of the summer,” Jack turns back to the road and starts rambling on again while Bitty holds on to his fingers. When he looks up at Jack’s softly smiling face, he can’t help but be a little more sad.

\*\*

Dex texts him the moment he’s back from spending time at home on the boat, wondering what in the fire he’s going to do with no one around, no one close to campus and it’s getting close to the end of June. He’s got almost two month left and no Nursie in sight or Chowder or anybody.

So after they send Kenny back to Las Vegas with food and chores to do for welcoming their draft picks, Bitty bundles up Jack and heads down to Samwell, back to the Haus since he’s got two weeks left until the first training camp starts.

His old room is empty and the bed is there, so he just brings his old sheets and they mess around with Dex for a few days. The next semester for Dex is looking better after skating with his old captain and an Alternate Captain of the Falcs at Faber when the light is just right.

Jack chirps him about those clinics while checking him right into the boards, laughs when Bitty just slides right on out without a whimper.

He thinks they talk a lot about managing the team and what to expect next year, and when they leave the rink, Dex is laughing again, standing taller, looking more comfortable wearing the big C on his jersey.

And well, Bitty can’t wait to go to the first game and cheer his boy right on.

Of course, they bake and chirp, run and go to the gym, take Dex to Jack’s house where he crashes in the guest room and assumes Bitty takes the couch.

(*He doesn’t.*)

Or to Bitty’s where he crashes in the guest room on the blow-up mattress and Jack snuggles up to Bitty in his bed instead.

But he never does get to see those little black briefs again, and that should be the real crime here.

\*\* (needs a rewrite because Bitty is trying to worm out of going to Vegas)

Between keeping Jack *and* Dex company over the summer, Bitty gets texts from the Rebels group chat, gets early access to the team arena. He’ll get to meet the team captain, run some drills, size up the team, that sort of thing. He accepts automatically, sending back an email to reserve his spot, biting his lip and looking at the calendar, wondering if he can make a trip to Madison for the 4th or not.

“That sucks,” Kenny is sympathetic over Skype, but it doesn’t make Bitty feel any better about missing out this year.

“I’ll...just have to find some time before September. I’ll have plenty of time to go back and see Mama and Coach before training and preseason. Besides, if I’m really going to do this, I’ve got to step into the life I guess.”

“You’re being smart,” and Kenny turns from where he’s chopping up some onion, pointing the knife at the laptop set safely on top the microwave. “You need to see who else is new to the game, Bits. It’s a competitive sport, you know.”

“I get that, sugar pie. I want to meet them, see how I stack up.”

“Eh. They’ll be better and worse than you, so don’t stress it. Go and be your best. That’ll be plenty.”

Bitty looks up from the quickly filling up calendar app on his phone and sighs. “Honey, you are wonderful.”

“Aww, I miss you too.”

“Don’t worry. You know Jack is planning a trip up there before the season starts, and I *demand* dancing.”

“Oh you *demand*.”

“Absolutely. You are the perfect height. Jack tries, but well, bless his heart.”

“If you promise to come hang out on the ice with Swoops, Scrappy, and Gopher, then I will take you to the *best* places.”

“Oh my. Mixing business with pleasure. Why am I not surprised?”

“I like to have my cake and eat it too, Bits,” and he turns enough to give the camera kissy noises.

“You silly shit,” but oh, it’s so fond because he feels like Kenny is so close sometimes, no matter how far away Vegas really is.

\*\*

Even though he hates, *hates* running, Jack has been a bad enough influence that he claws his way out of bed in the morning to swallow a mouthful of coffee, and just get it over with.

He starts out going down the main streets, looking at the store fronts and learning where the park is, finds an amphitheatre and everything.

He starts making stops at a quaint coffee shop for bottles of water, talks to a few people that yes, he just moved to town. He usually waves at the owner of the antique store where Lardo bought a pretty neat clock she said she would use in a project, and Jack thought it a good enough subject to get a photo.

He shops at the local grocery store more than going to Wal-Mart unless he has to, and Jack (sometimes with Dex) obliges him with his normal stops when the mornings are in Pawtucket and June rolls in fine as can be.

It’s one of those mornings he’s just lost in the music and the movement, pretending he’s talking to Jack about that video he wants to make and *yes*, he did watch some tapes for pointers. It’s *summer* for crying out loud, and he just graduated, but *homework?* Why how dare you–

When he comes on two ladies outside the local food pantry, talking loudly about not know *what* in the world they’re going to do without someone to cook brunch for the homeless this week. It’s so awful their regular person had an emergency, and there’s going to be at least a hundred people–

He might slow down a little when it’s–

“Who do we know that could cook for that many people on such short notice?”

He doesn’t even realize he’s slowing down, turning mid-step, and comes right up to them standing there fretting up a storm.

He’s all huffy from running, but waves a hand, “hi. I’m Eric Bittle. I moved here about a month ago, and I can cook for that many people. Do you need me to run to the market?”

Turns out, he didn’t even have to. They had a right nice kitchen there with all kinds of things in the refrigerator ready to go.

He talked himself on past them in his running shorts and t-shirt, phone in his back pocket, washes his hands, puts on a clean apron hanging on one of the shelves.

They tell him what their regular person was going to make, and he sees it coming together with plenty of supplies.

“Well that’s not gonna be hard at all. Long as I can find some utensils and such,” and then he’s off and running, hefting a pot on the stove almost his size and starting water for boiling potatoes, plans on letting them sit for a while to take some of the starch out. Finds the perfect pots and pants, warmers, all the things he loves using on a much bigger level.

(*The mixer is a dream and he tells the girls that, patting it like a puppy.*)

Ariel and Diana are just the sweetest things in the world, and they run the food pantry. Mostly they have volunteers, but their normal chef had a family emergency and the back-up person is out of state.

He waves it off while moving around the stainless steel countertops like it’s his own kitchen. He’s got prep done in no time, listing and talking while he’s peeling potatoes and letting the cube steak thaw. He tells them about Madison, and Samwell, and even how nervous he is to play for the Rebels.

“Wow, not to offend you or anything, but you’re a small guy,” Ariel looks sheepish when she says it.

“I sure am, honey, but I’m also fast,” he gives her a wink while making the gravy.

“That is really exciting though. I love going to the games!”

“We will absolutely cheer you on, Eric.”

“Oh! Why, thank-you so much!”

And it’s really as easy as breathing sometimes, cooking, baking, knowing he’s going to feed people. Before he knows it, the potatoes are perfectly cooked and seasoned, in warming pans, the baked steak and gravy turns out wonderfully that Ariel and Diana swoon. He’s got two kinds of vegetables and some nice pies for dessert.

People start trickling in around lunchtime while he’s cleaning up his mess, and there’s more volunteers to start serving the food. He meets them with smiles and flour on his face, happy he seems to be getting good with the locals.

After a while, he comes out to watch people meander in, eat, then leave, checks on the supplies, helps out where he needs to.

He doesn’t realize how nice it is to be doing something that doesn’t seem like just passing the time until he starts summer training. This feels like something he should be doing, so before he leaves, waving his good-byes, he gives Ariel his phone number, adding his name to the list of fall back cooks.

\*\*

He hates those expressions. Really he does.

Jack’s eyebrows are drawn together like when he’s puzzling something out, and Kenny looks utterly devastated.

“What do you *mean* you’re not going to come to Las Vegas?”

After thinking about it, him coming along might be...awkward if Jack and Kenny want to have some, you know, *alone time*.

“Sugar pie, what I meant is–”

“But, but, I want to go *dancing*, B!”

*You should do that with your boyfriend, honey*.

“And I already told the Aces you were coming down to play around on the ice!”

*Also something you should do with your hockey-playin’ boyfriend*.

“Now, Kenny–”

“Bitty,” and that’s Jack, looking up from Bitty’s new kitchen table where he’d been watching games from last season on his laptop, “what’s going on, bud?”

His breath catches a little because Jack is giving him that sloe-eyed look and Kenny is leaning down to the camera, laying in bed without a shirt on, so much pouting is happening right there.

“I-I just thought you two boys might want to-to catch up, is all, and I didn’t want to be *in the way* of that.” Here he goes again, trying to tell them without really telling them.

“B,” Kenny comes back seriously, “you know what a mess we are without you.”

“Why of all the foolishness! You are both professional hockey players!”

Jack shrugs, “Still, he’s not wrong.”

And *dang it, you two*. How is he supposed to push them into dating if they keep bringing him in on things!

“So, you’re coming to Las Vegas with Jack, right?” And the look right there, that pouty, big-eyed pleading that just makes Bitty’s heart pound.

“I–”

“Yeah, he’s coming.” Jack answers for him. “Dex will survive without you for a week, Bits, I promise.”

“Oh? And what am I going to do about training for Rebel camp, Jack?”

*Ha! He can use Hockey against them!*

“You can train here, no problem,” Kenny grins at him, “I’ll talk to the right people about having the rink for the week. I bet my guys won’t mind coming to help, either.”

If Moomaw had any idea the words going through his mind right now, she would be utterly *appalled*.

\*\*

Part of the professional athlete deal is the travelling, so none of it is awful anymore. It’s really even better when Kenny is smiling right there with the other people waiting on their friends and family.

He keeps smiling and slows on down a little for Jack to get to their–*his*– HIS boy first, throw both arms around Kenny, and get a whole lot of hugging in return.

He sighs with his heart in his eyes at how differently they look, genuine and happy, compared to even a year ago. They’ve come far, and Bitty takes incredible pride at being able to say he’s had a hand in helping them get there.

## \*\*

## \*\* The Rebels

All the information for the Rebel’s Training Camp tells him when to show up and what he’ll need to have for the first week. He’s set to meet the team before camp starts and adds phone numbers to his contact list.

He’s also got to talk to the PR representative about things like *managing approved social media accounts. *He spends almost *two days* watching videos, filling out paperwork, and talking to people that manage the team in the background.

He meets so many new faces, and tries to be as polite as his Mama taught him.

The day he’s set to meet the team, he’s got his gear bag, and a case of nerves right down to his stomach, but he takes a deep breath, and makes sure his pie carrier is set right.

He’s set to go on a tour before the rest of the team gets there, so he sets out the pies and plates, gets his assigned station in the locker room, and is shooed out the door for his tour.

The PR assistant explains to him he’s the only Rookie on the Rebels this year, since the other two have already accepted offers from the NHL instead, and so this orientation might not take as long as suspected.

Worse. It takes *longer*.

He doesn’t even get to get out on the ice with the team, just gets brought by when they’re already done with practice for the day.

He gets a general introduction while a bunch of sweaty athletes are in the middle of getting ready to go home. Some of them come up to shake his hand, tell him they’ll see him on the ice. The two big Defensemen, guys called *Nickel and Dime* for heaven’s sake, don’t say a word through his nervous ramblings, just shake his hand and go on.

The Rebel’s Captain, Leroy “Racoon” Wyatt, is the one that takes him aside in one of the conference rooms, and gives him an introduction to the team.

By the time they’re done, the locker room is empty, and he’s still chatting up his new team Captain when he realizes–

–the pies are still there. Not a slice gone.

He’s struck right through the heart, “oh...Maybe they don’t like pie?” But it *hurts*.

“Huh?” Racoon eyes the pies on the table Bitty picks up forlornly. “Oh! You brought all that, Bittle?”

“I made it,” he sighs, “in Georgia, we always take something when we’re going to meet somebody. I’m so sad no one wanted any.”

“Ah, that’s my fault, kid, sorry.” And Racoon might not be as big as Jack, but he’s still a big guy, and the hand he puts on Bitty’s shoulder takes up almost all of it. “I wasn’t sure who it was for, so I told the guys to leave ‘em alone.”

“Oh!” He perks up a little.

“Let’s leave ‘em in the fridge for tomorrow. We’ll getcha out on the ice, let the boys see what you got.”

It’s nice and all, but still, he doesn’t count it as a successful first day. Instead of weighing down Jack and Kenny when they Skype that night, he’s vague about it being so busy, busy, and deflects to Kenny’s kids hockey camp.

Jack tries to go back to the Rebels, but Bitty yawns and bids them good-night, he’s got an early day tomorrow.

He feels a little bit bad not sharing because he literally tells Jack and Kenny *everything*, but figures he’ll talk them up when he actually gets on the ice.

\*\*

His real first day is utterly brutal, which is kind of what he expected, but *still*.

He thanks the good Lord for the tub because he lays in water as hot as he can stand it for the ache and stretch in his muscles.

Jack has a team bonding thing he’s going to, so it’s only him and Kenny that night.

“You look beat feet, B.”

“I feel about beat, sugar pie. It was rough.”

“It will get better, I promise.”

“I know it will. The first week or so is always a pain.”

Kit mews at him and bats at the phone with her paw. Kenny seems to know what he needs without him having to say it out loud, and chatters on about Swoops and Gopher running the kids around on their shoulders, and how Snappy got a puppy this week.

He talks about heading to Aces Arena to start going over the upcoming season with coaches and management and staff. What kind of events they want to tackle as a team. He gets a first look at the tentative schedule, already talking about his next visit to Providence, and already mourning he can’t be there in person for Bitty’s first game.

“I doubt I’ll be on first line this year at all, sugar pie, so it isn’t any skin off my nose. Don’t you worry about it.”

“Bits, as you’ve already figured out, the Rebs have a tendency to lose Rookies to the NHL. You’ll be on the front line before you know it.”

“I appreciate your faith.”

“Experience, not faith. I’ve been with you on the ice, remember?”

“Mmhm. We’ll just see what happens, I guess. Maybe they’ll hate me enough to put me on fourth line, who knows?”

“Aw, c’mon, B.”

“Kenny, I’m the first out player in the AHL. I might be a Rookie, but I’m not naive enough to think I’m here *just* because I’m fast.”

Kenny’s face leans in closer to the screen, “B, do you think–”

“They’re using me to show how *progressive* the league is? Why not? Would be a smart move, wouldn’t it, sugar pie?”

“Oh, B.”

“It’s all right. Once they see what I can do, it’ll be a whole different tune.”

“That’s the spirit.”

“You know it. They don’t even know what they’ve got.”

And Kenny’s eyes are soft, and he’s looking at Bitty like he’s the only thing important in the world...kind of how he looks at Jack sometimes.

And after they finally say good-bye, Bitty refuses to think about what that might say about him and Kenny.

\*\*

Does he survive training camp?

Well, yes he does, thank-you very much.

Is he bruised as all get out making his vlogs four Saturdays in a row?

This is also sadly true.

But dang it, his viewers asked for the secret of baklava and he is aiming to *deliver*.

He’s just finished cleaning up and plans the rest of his afternoon around editing the video and being all-out-and-out lazy before they start gearing up for preseason.

## AHL!Bitty, injury, pining, pimbits.

He comes out of practice fairly vibrating.

The upcoming game against the Phantoms is terrifying, and not just because he’s starting on the first line. Nope, for the first time since the season started, Jack has the opportunity to come, and apparently Kenny is too. He’s supposed to be flying in today so Jack told him this morning.

“Why is Kenny coming to town again?” Because he’s sucking down a protein shake on his way to the arena. It’s early, he’s had a long week, and he feels like he’s been beat into the ground.

“*Bits, *he doesn’t have a game and neither do I. We’re going to come cheer for our favorite Reb.”

It’s hard to be irritated when Jack’s being so sweet, dang it.

“...I appreciate it, honey. You know the two of you didn’t have to go through all the fuss.” He pulls into the parking lot, gearing down and listening to Jack’s voice through the speakers.

“You’d do it for us, bud. It sucks I haven’t been able to come until now.”

“You’re a sweetheart. When are you picking him up?”

And the plan from there was for Bitty to get to practice and drive on down to Providence, meet them at Jack’s place so they could all go out to dinner.

Since he gets to see Kenny, he thinks he’ll be able to survive being sore as a bull afterwards.

It’s only his second week as Racoon’s right wing, and he’s still looking for his footing, the connection in the line to *know*. Like he’d had with Dex and Holster and Shitty and Ransom and Chowder and Jack and Kenny…

(*Lord, he can’t think of them like that. He has to stop those things and break his own heart*.)

The player in him knows he can’t force it, just has to look out for any cues, know the plays, watch for an opening, all the standard things any coaches’ kid would know. He’s been in sports for a hell of a long time, and Eric R. Bittle is a darn good athlete. He can do this. It’s gonna be tough, but he’s tougher.

“That’s better,” Jack says from his dash holder, “you look ready.”

And maybe that gets a half-smile because Jack is grabbing his keys, already has his bag on his shoulder, and still winks in the phone. “Go get ‘em, Bits.”

“Thanks, honey. Have a good day,” and disconnects. He stretches his legs, grabs his bag, and gets a move on.

They’ve got a game in two days, and he’s starting with Racoon, Wheelhouse, Patty, Nickel, and Dime against the Phantoms.

He’s darn determined to make it a game to remember.

\*\*

Coach started out this mess substituting Honda for him during a few preseason games, and he did pretty well as right wing to Racoon’s center and Wheelhouse’s left wing. Racoon is a big guy, and Bitty is just faster, so he can pull apples all day long if either Nickel or Dime can keep the other team off his back.

Which is apparently a good enough strategy for Coach to sub him in more often.

When Honda’s bad knees gives him fits, or Wheelhouse gets roughed up before their enforcers can get to him, Coach has started calling Bitty in to play.

He’s fast enough to get around most Defenseman without getting checked too often, and it’s a good thing for the Rebels. Most of their players are big guys, skilled but not as fast as their remaining rookie. Bitty can literally run circles around the guys on the ice with him right now, and his struggle is to keep his pace while still working with the rest of the line.

He’s been coming in early and staying late, trying to get better, faster, more in tune. He watches the tapes sometimes when Senor Bun isn’t enough to help him drift off, catches the ticks in his teammates and what those things mean.

He knows the turn of Racoon’s glove means incoming, Wheelhouse uses a pointer finger when he’s ready to pass.

\*\*

He knows he made a very bad mistake using his extra key because when Jack sits up, he doesn’t have a shirt on, and his mouth is all swollen.

“Bits,” strained and shocked.

“Oh my God, I’m sorry. I-I should have just knocked. I’m sorry,” because he recognizes those expensive tennis shoes leading up to legs around Jack’s waist. The blonde head and gray eyes barely visible over Jack’s bare shoulder tells him his suspicions have always been right on.

At least his body is with the program, and he’s backing out while babbling on until he’s literally at the front door.

Jack’s lean form is peeking around the doorway to the living room. He’s stood up from the couch, still no shirt, and his eyebrows doing that squinty thing when he’s reasoning things out.

“Bud, you don’t have to go–”

“Oh no, I really, really should,” and then he’s out the door. If he took off the second the door closed, well, only one of Jack’s neighbors would be able to rat him out.

His legs are sore taking those stairs so fast, but he can hide out most of tomorrow. They’ve got a meet in the morning, more to go over plays than literally killing him.

Which would be nice, his brain tells him as he quick-walks out of Jack’s apartment building, his heart racing, his body just moving in some self-preservation instinct maybe.

(*Because they didn’t even *tell him* they were going out. All the hint dropping, all the help. It hurts they didn’t trust him, maybe didn’t think he’d support them even though he would, one hundred ten percent. And on the other side of him, where he’s all torn up, mourning his two best friends off the market but being so dang happy for them at the same time. It’s so complicated and this is what he gets when he doesn’t tell Lardo the truth.*)

He starts his truck before he realizes his phone is going off and his vision is a little wavery. He swipes his hand over his eyes and realizes his sleeve is wet.

Well. Dang it.

Deep breath through his nose while the engine warms and starts blasting heat. His hands are steady to be on the wheel so he pulls out of the parking lot, very pointedly looking at his phone without touching it. He is now driving and that is enough of a flakey excuse not to answer any phone calls.

(*It’s a good thing. This is what I’ve been working for, right? For them to be happy?*)

Until a Bruce Springsteen ringtone fills the silence in the truck.

His thumb swipes before he thinks, “Shitty?”

“Hey! There you are!”

“What?” Because what? This is Shitty we’re talking about. He could be anywhere at any time, and Bitty checks the back seat from the rearview mirror just in case.

“Yeah, hey. You okay?”

“I-I’m fine, Shitty. How-how are you?”

“Getting calls from Jack saying he’s worried about you driving right now. Want to tell me about that?”

Oh no. “I’ve been killing myself in practice this week, that’s all.”

“Yeah, yeah, yeah, practice,” but Shitty sounds real soft, real gentle for some reason.

“We...we’re playing the Phantoms, Shitty.”

“Mmhm.”

“They changed our line-up.”

“Ooh, rough.”

“My legs hurt, my knees hurt, so I’m going to go home and just have a soak in the tub.”

“Sounds like a good idea.”

“Yeah, yeah, it is,” and his voice sounds wavery because Shitty sounds so soothing.

“And why didn’t you answer Jack’s phone call and tell him that, Bit-O?”

Here’s where he’s got to be quiet, got to just let it go, play it off, be cool about it–

“Because I should have knocked first and now I can’t talk to him,” is what he blurts out instead, blinking rapidly again and wiping his eyes. “I’m so embarrassed, Shitty.”

“You should have knocked first? B-Man–”

“I-I interrupted something pretty private, Shitty.”

“Oh, Jack didn’t say that.”

And of course, he’s chomping at the bit to say, *well, what did Jack ****say**** for heaven’s sake?* But he already knows how Shitty will answer that, *answer his fucking calls, Bitty, and you’d know.*

“Y-Yeah, so...So please just tell him I’m fine, and I’m having an early night.”

“I mean, if I was Lards, I would tell you to call Jack yourself, you know that.”

“But you’re not Lardo,” he counters desperately. “Sometimes you can be swayed by the suffering of others.”

Shitty laughs at him because *where’s the lie?* “Right. Okay, I’ll call Jack back and let him know you’re going to crash.”

He shudders in relief, “Shitty, thank-you.”

“But, I am going to tell you Jack sounded really worried.”

“Shitty–”

“Like, his anxiety might be acting up–”

*Oh. Oh, no, Jack.*

“Talking to you would probably help.”

And Bitty closes his eyes for a second, using language that would get his mouth washed out with soap.

“Shitty–” and he enters Pawtucket’s city limits.

“Bitty.”

And he slows down once he hits the main street close to his house, his chest aches like fire, and his eyes are all puffy.

“Hey, sorry. It’s okay, I’ll–”

“No, you’re right. Once I pull into the driveway, I’ll...I’ll text him or something.” Even if he doesn’t want to, if he’s on a tilt-a-whirl of emotion, if he really *is* still sore and tired and nervous and anxious about the game this week.

“...Bits, on Saturday I’m coming to Pawtucket.”

“Aren’t you coming up on the end of the semester, Shitty?”

“Next week.”

“Then stay right where you are and get your work done.” But does he hate to say it. There’s nothing more he wants than Shitty, Lardo, Ransom, and Holster to help take some of the pressure off him, to be a nice deflection so he can hurt, but at least they’ll chirp him, then smother him in affection and jokes.

“After the semester. I’ll come down and stay with you for a few days. We can talk, okay?”

Finally, he pulls into his spot outside the garage door, thinks about everything, takes a deep, deep breath. He should be happy for Jack and Kenny. He should be supportive and glad they’ve finally come to a place they can be together. He shouldn’t be feeling worried they won’t have time for him anymore. He shouldn’t be feeling maybe a teeny, tiny bit jealous.

“That sounds nice, Shitty. I miss y’all so much.”

“It’s been a rough semester, so I’m sorry I haven’t–”

“Don’t you *dare*, Byron Sterling Knight.”

“*Bits*. The full name?!”

“I can and will pull it out when need be, Shitty. Don’t try me.”

The laugh on the other end sounds nice and full, so maybe the end of his semester isn’t killing him after all.

“All right, B. All right.”

“Good. Now, you go back to studying, and I’m gonna go in the house and text Jack. Everything is okay.”

He shuts off the truck and grabs his phone and hockey bag. He is going to be a good friend to them. And that’s that. And Bitty manages to talk himself right around being embarrassed and maybe a little heartsick.

He hobbles his sore self inside and locks the door behind him, has his phone out with a text already composed to Jack, apologizing for not knocking first, and telling how he’s so *sore* and *tired* and he’ll absolutely hang out with them after the game.

The big tub is running when he stops fiddling with it and just hits *Send*. He calms his nerves by making himself put the phone *down* and starts pulling off his shirt, jeans, pants, and socks. He checks the water temperature when his phone starts ringing again, and this time he does answer.

“Bitty–”

“Hi Jack,” he groans when he stands up again, the water running in the background.

“Bud, you all right?”

And now he feels just awful because Shitty was right, Jack sounds like he’s been pacing, like he’s worried.

“I’m tired and my legs hurt,” he doesn’t try to stop the whine in his voice, “this week has been *hell* and-and I’m sorry I just left. That was rude, yes, but I was-was interrupting and I should have knocked--”

“Hey, hey,” and now Jack sounds better, sounds amused and softer, “you don’t have to knock. We were waiting for you to decide where we should go to eat anyway.”

And Bitty bites down on his lower lip very hard not to talk about the elephant in the room in case this was something that might be ruined if he brings it up first.

*Honey, you didn’t have a shirt on and Kenny’s legs were around you. I’m thinking eating was probably the furthest thing from your mind*. *Well, not eatin’ food anyhow*.

So he turns the water off and puts the phone on speaker, throwing his clothes off. Toes in the water first.

“You’ve got a big game day after tomorrow, and I understand how hockey can be, Bits. Get in a hot bath, relax, get some sleep--”

Yup. That’s right, it’s all about hockey, Jack.

“Bath is happening,” he groans as he sinks down slowly, water sloshing gently against his protesting legs and hips.

He misses a breathless “*oh*” come over the phone.

“Goodness that feels nice,” he sinks down to his collar bones and thanks the realtor again for this massive tub. “And how is Kenny? He get in okay?”

“Euh. He’s running to that place you like, picking up food,” in Providence, Jack doesn’t mention how they’d ordered his favorite too for just in case they could persuade Bitty to come back.

But, by the sound of it, his bud is having a rough go before a big game, and Jack knows all the layers under that, the stresses and strains hitting the body and brain.

There’s a soft *mmhm* over the line with the sound of water and Jack has to close his eyes so he doesn’t think about things like *naked*, *wet*, and *Bitty*.

(*He still does, and heat lights up at the base of his spine.*)

\*\* (Hm, going to edit this because I have a better idea above. Maybe more angst for my poor heart)

The folks are real nice at Urgent Care, and they recognize him from the Rebels, so it’s good he doesn’t have to answer uncomfortable questions about how he managed to hurt himself like this.

“That hit tonight was awful,” the PA sympathizes while looking at X-Rays. “Is there anyone I need to call for you?”

Her eyes went to his phone where he keeps turning down FaceTime requests from Jack and Kenny. It’s gettin’ late, he’s gettin’ tired, and damn it, he’s trying to answer all the questions right the first time.

“It’s all right. I didn’t even know it was this bad when I left tonight, but I’ll call my trainers in the morning, let them know what happened.”

“Well, our on-call is coming in to make sure it’s dislocated. From there, he’ll let you know if we can do something more about it here or if you might need to go to the Emergency Room.”

“I appreciate it,” and he *does* because his side is a mass of angry red, purple, and black. It hurts when he raises his arm now, but at least it’s not so hard to get a full breath.

She turns off half the lights in the room and backs out, leaving him to finally check his phone.

Kenny sent messages on Twitter while Jack just stuck with old faithful and sent him a text.

*Sweet Summer Child*: Killer game tonight.

*Sweet Summer Child:* Call me when you can.

*Sweet Summer Child:* We’re outside waiting for you

*Sweet Summer Child:* Bits?

He sighs deep and narrows his eyes in the dim.

*Me:* Sorry, in the middle of something [honey emoji] you two go out and have a good time!

Bits doesn’t get time to put his phone down when the next message comes in.

He lets it go for a while when the on-call is a nice man that pushes harder than Eric would like, gets a noise of pain out of him because goodness, that hurts.

But, they can put it right while he’s there instead of making him go to the hospital or wait to go to a chiropractor, so he’s going to be fine. He needs about a week of little exertion and his back is probably going to hurt for a while, but well, he’s used to aches and pains.

The fact he’s going to need to tell Racoon, the trainers, and the Coaches of the Rebels is a bitter bite that sits in the back of his mind while he tries to relax, let his mind wander so he can relax enough for–

It still hurts like the devil when they put his rib back in.

He can breathe easier and hauls his sorry butt up in the truck, is okay leaning on the steering wheel without starting up, just letting the exhaustion roll over him for a long few minutes. He needs it because *Lord*, it’s been a hard few weeks, hadn’t it?

He’ll get back to Jack and Kenny in a minute or so when he starts–

The next thing Bitty knows, he realizes he’s freezing cold and something muffled is getting through the haze of sleep. Something shifts under him, rocks, and he jerks hard enough to almost yell out, both arms going to the bandages wrapped around him to keep his rib in place. He grinds his back teeth, forehead on the steering wheel again while the red hot burn takes a few breaths to calm down.

The muffled thumping comes back, faster and clearer than before.

Bitty jumps, making his darn side hurt again, but it gets him looking out the window to see–

“Jack?”

His brain isn’t making sense of what he’s seeing, nonetheless trying to figure out the words from Jack’s moving mouth through the cold window. It’s all too confusing for someone that just apparently woke up from a cat nap.

But thumping on the other side of the truck, and he knows he’s dreaming or hallucinating because there is no possible way the captain of the Las Vegas Aces is on the other side of his truck, beating on his windows, too.

But Kenny smiles when he sees he’s got Bitty’s attention and talks slowly, mouth moving with exaggerated emphasis, muffled through the rolled up windows, and a sliver of cold rides up Bitty’s spine, making him shiver and his side to burn even hotter.

“I can’t even believe any of this. What are you even *doing* here? I *told* ya’ll to go on out and have a good time!”

And he just rambles on, pauses when Kenny slaps a palm on the window, finger pointing to the bottom of the door, and Bitty just does not understand at *all*.

The thumping by his ear, and he swings back to where Jack is holding something up against the window.

The daze is lifting when Bitty reads the screen of Jack’s phone pressed against the glass, his other finger pointing at the text message:

**unlock the doors**

“Oh,” that’s what all the hollering is about? Well, for heaven’s sake.

His fingers are tingling in the gloves he hasn’t taken off, so it takes a second for the *click*.

The doors jerk open on either side, and he’s suddenly surrounded by hockey players.

“Bits,” is Jack’s stern captain voice, and for a second, Bitty just freezes.

“Hey, hey,” is Kenny from the other side, a knee on the seat, leaning in, and sliding the paperwork from the Urgent Care out of his hand. “How you doing, B? I *missed* you!”

His heart gives a little thump at that, but he reminds himself he literally walked in on them making out. “Kenny, Jack, how did you find me?”

He gets a patient look, “B. Didn’t I *tell* you to set your location to private on Snapchat? You're on the map. It took like two seconds, and at an *Urgent Care*? Jack was flipping out.”

Oh well, that explains that, doesn’t it?

He looks up at Jack a little sheepishly, “yeah, sorry about that.”

“Luckily I have people other than you that can work social media,” Jack pulls off his glove, that pinch still between his eyebrows, but the warm hand he puts on Bitty’s forehead feels amazing because he finally realizes he is *freezing*. “We waited around in the parking lot, but didn’t see you leave.”

“Did you have fun at the game?” He blinks under Jack’s hand.

“We *absolutely* had fun watching you kick ass,” Kenny is looking over the papers, wincing a little when Bitty looks over at him. “Good win! That shot dislocated a rib though, so kind of shitty, B. Sorry.”

Kenny holds the paperwork out to Jack while still smiling at Bitty, but it’s tight around the edges.

“You’re telling me, sugar pie.” And Bitty is more awake now that he’s being crowded in the truck by two NHL hockey players that have apparently been searching him out. “But, it’s fine. I’m awake now, and I am cold to the *bone*. So I should drive on home an’ –”

“*Nope*,” Jack vetoes before the thought is fully out of his mouth. “I’ll drive your truck, you get in the SUV with Kenny.” Jack fixes him with those blue eyes when he looks up from the Urgent Care paperwork.

Bitty gasps and snatches it back out of his hands (because he’ll need it for the trainers tomorrow but honestly, Jack, it’s *fine*), and starts with, “Jack Zimmerman, I am a grown man–”

“You drive a clutch,” Kenny interrupts, “it’s going to hurt when you’ve got to shift, right?”

And Bitty just closes his eyes and sighs because *Lord, these boys*.

Jack is already starting to pull him gently by the elbow until he’s at the edge of the bench seat. It’s nice when he leans down to get Bitty’s arm over his shoulders, means he can let Jack take some of his weight as Kent opens the passenger door on the big SUV with the heat already blasting inside.

They exchange a few words while Kent leans in to buckle him in so he doesn’t have to move too much. A hand smoothes over his hair before the door is shut and those two are moving in sync like they’re in the middle of a play.

Jack gets in Bitty’s oldnew truck and fires the engine. He rolls the windows down to talk to Kent and then the shorter of the two is opening the door to the SUV and climbing in beside Bitty, sliding his seat belt on and looking over at his passenger before dropping it into drive.

“Hey, it’s okay, we’re going to take you home and help you get a nice shower, then we’ll put some ice on that side–” Kenny is talking without looking away from the road, following Jack’s (*Bitty’s*) taillights.

“C-can’t believe you came... a-all the way here fer one game,” Bitty replies, drowsy again now that he’s starting to unthaw.

Kenny turns to him quickly because–

Oh, his teeth are chattering now, aren’t they?

But Kenny tugs off a glove with his teeth and lays a warm palm on Bitty’s forehead and then on his cold cheek, and *oh*, that’s so nice, honey.

“I’m glad,” Kenny smiles clear up to his eyes, and he’s just so handsome that way.

“Oh? You think I’m handsome, huh, B?”

Oh Lord. He’s saying these things *out loud*.

“Yeah, you are, but you were hurt tonight, so I’m totally giving you an out.”

“Thank-you, sugar pie,” is slurry and soft, Bitty’s eyes half-closed already and the heat blasting him right in the face.

\*\*

Kenny looks around with a small smile while Jack hefts his bag inside and goes down the hallway knowledgeably to put it in the closet.

“Go on and make yourself at home,” he hangs up his coat, still shuddery and cold. “There’s drinks in the fridge or coffee? Remotes are on the couch, okay?”

But Kenny’s gray eyes come back to him holding his side gingerly, and he’s got a big ole hand wrapped around his elbow, and the other rubbing the back of his neck, warm and just *nice*. “How about we warm you up and then get some ice on your side, huh? Some ibuprofen. You’ve got all kinds of stuff to eat, so I’ll make some finger foods, and we’ll binge watch Netflix or something.”

The sigh coming out of him is soft and sweet because what has he done in his life to deserve such good friends.

“To be honest, that sounds pretty amazing right now. Sorry, this probably ain’t gonna be an exciting night on the town after a win. But, I’m home and I’m fine! You and Jack can go on out and enjoy–”

“Jack,” the man himself interrupts, coming back down the hall, “is staying right here to binge watch Netflix and change ice bags on your side.”

“Same,” Kenny shrugs, not moving his hands at all.

He lets his forehead rest on Kenny’s shoulder for a minute or so, just long enough to let some of the tension out. “Well, all right then. Let me get a quick shower and we’ll watch something good. No documentaries, Jack.” He chirps with a half grin, but knows he probably looks worn to the bone.

The guffaw is good-natured, and he’s got Jack turning him out of Kenny’s shoulder, walking him down the hallway to his bedroom.

There’s comfortable pajama pants and a big t-shirt set out for him and the light in the bathroom is already on. Jack walks him in, leans him against the wall and starts the shower himself.

“You tracking there, bud? Gotta talk to me so I know where you’re at.”

He blinks and realizes he’d been almost dozing, trying to stay upright as much as possible.

“Mmhm, I’m here.”

Jack maneuvers him to sit on the sink, kneels down to pull Bitty’s shoes and socks off, stands back up while the steam starts coming over the top of the shower. He gasps softly when big hands slide under the hem of his sweater, slowly starts sliding *up*. Jack’s gentle about maneuvering it off him without jostling his side or his arm too much. He finds the little metal pieces that keep the bandages tight, unwinds it with Bitty’s arms over his shoulders.

(*He’d done something similar after a hard Falcs game Jack’s second year in the NHL. Somehow it didn’t feel as heavy as it does now. He knows he’s blushing like mad with those hands all on him like this.*)

He almost stops Jack from unbuttoning his jeans and taking them down his thighs, but the intense look on his face when he sees the dark, angry black, red, and purple taking up most of his side makes him close his mouth.

But he is completely unprepared for Jack stripping off his own shirt and starting to shimmy out of his pants.

“Wh-what on earth–?”

Jack’s brows furrow just as his thumbs hook in his tiny black boxer briefs, “I’m not going to leave you alone. You might pass out and hit your head.”

“You’re going to get in the shower with me?” Because honestly, how is this his life?

“That’s why I’m stripping down, Bits.”

“J-Jack! Kenny is right in my living room for heaven’s sake!”

The pause, Jack’s utterly blank expression is not what he’d been expecting, “...oh. You-You want him to get in the shower with you instead?”

“What?! Lord! *Jack*.” Deep breath, Eric. Deep breath. “Please try to understand what I’m *saying*.”

“Break it down for me, eh? I want to get you warmed up sooner rather than later.”

“N–okay,” momentary pause for this one, “the person currently in my kitchen making snacks might not be too keen on you-you getting in the shower with another man. Does that…?” And he’s fumbling all over the place now isn’t he? “Jack, I don’t want to...*upset* anybody.”

And he must look pitiful and sore and hurt because Jack just blinks at him with wide eyes. It only takes a second for Jack’s expression to change, and Bitty sees him literally *get it*. What he’s been saying for over a year without really saying anything at all.

He doesn’t expect Jack to be right up on him, both hands suddenly on the bathroom wall behind him, bracketing him in on either side--

(*and for a second, looking up at Jack’s serious face, that tension is back no matter how tired and sore he is. There’s no one in the universe that could possibly be unaffected by this man looming over you without a shirt on, and apparently very close to taking off the awful tease that shouldn’t even be considered briefs.*)

“Later, we are going to talk, but for now, I promise no one is going to get upset about me taking care of you. Just like you always take care of me, eh? It’s okay, bud. Don’t think so hard.”

Just like that, Jack pushes down his underwear and moves to do the same for Bitty, just hooks his thumbs in the waistband for a second.

And his cheeks warm up and he doesn’t trust himself to speak, so all he does is nod, breathless. But he absolutely burns the expression on Jack’s face in his mind when he helps Bitty step out of his briefs and is face-to-face with what the Lord gave him.

He almost whimpers when Jack unconsciously licks his lips before he seems to shake himself enough to stand.

And if he doesn’t feel ridiculously cared for while Jack’s arms help hold him up, and those hands taking his loofa up and down his back all gentle, washes Bitty’s hair so he doesn’t have to reach up, well, then only Jack would be able to tell.

\*\*

They end up putting something on Netflix while Bitty’s bundled up in blankets with ice bags on his side wound with bandages, but it’s really only for white noise because Jack and Kenny are talking about the game.

“And what the hell was wrong with #54, Bits? He should have stopped that check. Guy was *right* fucking there, and *you* were in possession of the puck.”

Jack hums in agreement, hand on the back of Bitty’s neck. “This isn’t the first time that’s happened.”

“I’ve gotten checked this season, captain. It’s hockey,” he chirps but really, he’s feeling nice with Kenny pretty much right up against his good side. “But it’s all right. I’m okay getting back up now, I promise.”

He sees the look exchanged between them and wonders if they even realize how cute they are.

“That’s not what I mean, and you know it,” Jack tries to be gentle about it, but his eyes are very serious.

“I’m the only rookie left on the Rebels, Jack. I’m taking my hits, just like anyone else.” And he makes sure his tone absolutely implies the *drop it* he’s too polite to say.

“Those goals you scored weren’t just Rookie luck, Bits,” Kenny interjects. “Those were pretty solid. Seems like you’ve already proved you can play the game.”

“Honey. You know as well as I do it takes years in professional sports. One or two good games don’t mean a darn thing.”

“I also know a lot of teams make billeting a requirement in your first year.”

“I spent four years living with hockey players, Kenny–”

“Your first pro year is a different story than college, Bits.” Jack’s hand gets tight for a second, and well, they probably have a point.

“I wasn’t sure any of the other Rebs would be...comfortable with me movin’ on in when they all know I’m out. That’s not a situation that would be good for getting used to doing this as a career. And I mean none of them had even met me yet, and I didn’t want to stay in a hotel for heaven’s sake, I *need* a kitchen!”

“Not saying you don’t, but the point is, we want to know if the team is still looking out for you.”

“They’re doing just fine by me.” And he lets his eyes close because this conversation is just uncomfortable.

A hand on his ankle, thumb rubbing over the bone, a different hand working the tight muscles in the back of his neck, “okay, bud, okay. But if they aren’t, you know you can tell us, right? That we’re here for you?”

“I’ve told you before, Jack. The AHL is my fight. You and Kenny can take on the NHL.”

“That doesn’t mean we can’t still care about you, B,” Kenny shifts on his couch so he’s looking down, “or that you can talk to us, you know?”

“I do talk to y’all,” he yawns a little and settles in deeper. “Yer my best friends, right?”

And why yes, of course they are, Bits, just like he knew they’d say. Just like that, he ends this conversation and drifts off with Jack’s big hand sneaking into his hair and Kenny’s fingers wrapping around his ankle.

\*\*

When he eventually does wake up enough to realize he’s in his bed, and he is not alone, Eric Bittle breathes in deeply, softly, and tries to make sure he’s got enough patience to deal with everything in his life before he even opens his eyes.

Sure enough, there’s Jack in front of him, sleeping on and Kenny’s forehead is right in the middle of Bitty’s back, snores muffled against Bitty’s sleep shirt. He’s got a bed for the guest room now. It’s made up and everything.

Jack knows that.

Moving is so bad and painful, worse than those concussions back at Samwell, but he scoots down out of the middle of his own bed and manages to get out without waking the two that were apparently sandwiching him in their sleep.

“It’s just ‘cuz I got hurt,” Bitty keeps up the mantra while he gets dressed for the day in the guest room, “and they were worried about a friend. That’s all.”

He makes a quick skillet of eggs, eats a few bites before calling to Rebel stadium and talking to the trainers about yesterday.

“Wait, you dislocated a *rib*?” Tiana is a dear, and Bitty loves her to pieces.

When she’s not mad, that is.

“Well, yes, but it’s already back in now–”

“Get your Georgia Peach ass down here *right now*. Wait. Do you need someone to come get you? Wait, how did you even *drive* last night?”

“It’s fine, it’s fine! I drove fine. I’ll leave in a few minutes, all right?”

“Eric.”

“Yes ma’am. I’m on the way.”

He stops long enough to leave a note with an arrow at the bottom pointed toward the skillet of eggs, grabs his hockey bag, and gently closes the front door behind him.

\*\*

Racoon meets him in the locker room and looks madder than a wet hen.

Which does not bode well, now does it?

The night after a game like this, the extra skate is optional. Usually Bitty is there with about two-thirds of the team that show up, and today is about the same. He’s here to drop his bag off at his stall before going to see Tiana, and Racoon just gives him one look.

“What happened to you last night? You should have been there for presser, Bittle.”

And goodness, he really doesn’t want to do this with the others obviously looking at him and listening in, so he tries to get through it as quickly as possible.

“Well, I, um. Went to Urgent Care last night–”

“You *what?*”

He winces because Wheelhouse and Booster are on their feet around him.

“It was a little hard to breathe and–”

“Whoa, kid. Who went with you?” And then Racoon is all up on him, arms crossed over his chest, and his eyebrows are squinty. He went from hopping mad to...still mad. There’s not going to be a bright side to this at all now is there?

“Well, I went myself, no harm done.”

“You *went*–” Racoon pauses and lets out a real long sigh.

In for a penny as Mama would say.

“It was just a dislocated rib. Okay, I mean, it wasn’t *just* because it hurt like the dickens by the time everyone had gone on home. But, the doctor put it back in and told me to take a couple of days. I called Tiana this morning to tell her what happened and see what I should do, so here I am to let her take a peek, and let ya’ll know I need a few days. That’s all.”

Nickel talks low to Dime and Honda is focused on taping his stick, mouth set in a grim line.

“Look Bittle,” and *uh-oh*, that tone sure might mean trouble. “You’re a grown man, so I’m not trying to be your mother except when we’re on the ice.”

That? Is an unpleasant image, thank-you very much.

“*But*, you’re not billeting with anyone, so when shit like this happens? You need to call someone on the Rebs immediately. If not me, Honda. If not him, Wheelhouse. If not him, Patty. Fuck, send a group message so someone can check in with you. Got it?”

He doesn’t see what the big deal is really, but when he was captain of the Wellies, he used to get fired up about one of his guys getting hurt, too. (*Not that he considers himself one of Racoon’s guys, not with how that game went last night*. *Win notwithstanding*.) So Bitty chalks it up to being a good captain and lets Racoon raise up his shirt to take a look. Since he had a heck of a time this morning getting dressed, he didn’t bother wrapping his ribs back up, and the dark coloring is right there.

Nickel and Dime don’t look him in the face.

Well, serves them right.

“Christ that looks bad. Okay, c’mon, we’ll go see what T has to say.”

“Probably the same thing that nice doctor did. *Wow, that looks like it smarts*. And you know what? He was right.” Bitty pulls the papers from the Urgent Care out of his bag and lets Racoon take his elbow, lead him out of the locker room and down the corridor.

He tries carefully not to look at anyone because it is plain old *embarrassing* to get walked like he’s going to see the principal or something.

Tiana is already there waiting, and also not very happy with him by the looks of it.

“Please tell me he yelled at you,” she immediately asks, then turns without getting an answer, “please tell me you yelled at him.”

“I yelled enough. He won’t do that again, right?”

“It’s fine. Nothing broken.”

“Hey, that doesn’t answer the question.”

He holds up a placating hand, “I will call you or Wheelhouse or Honda next time. Promise.”

She gives him a look his Mama would say *brews with infinite patience quickly running out*.

So he lays down on her table with his shirt off and deals with a whole lot of prodding while Racoon reads the papers and a few guys heading for the ice walk slowly by the door to peek in on their way.

As much as he doesn’t want to, he raises his arm high up enough to put it over his eyes while she does her messing around.

“You’re going to need a few days before you get back on skates, Bitty,” there’s a towel over the worst of the bruising on the outside of his shirt and ice bags on his side held with more flexible bandages. “I want you reclining, minimal movement for forty-eight hours at least. Don’t come back here until next Friday.”

“*Next Friday?*”

“Next Friday.”

He thunks his head back.

“You heard the lady. Take it easy, then come back and play hockey. I’ll let the coaches and everyone else know.”

Bitty just sighs because there’s really not much else he can do.

“Did someone drive you by the way?” Tiana helps him ease up straight with the bags on one side. “I would rather you not drive in the forty-eight hour time.”

“I drove myself, it’s fine,” but oh did shifting hurt like mad.

“Bitty,” Racoon shakes his head. “Okay, I think Honda can drive a stick, so he can drive your wreck, and *I’ll* drive you home.”

Home. Where Jack and Kenny are waiting.

That is such a terrible idea.

“No! Um, I–” his face is flushing and he dang well *knows* that, and looks pleadingly at Tiana, trying to cast some kind of mind meld so she would get what he was asking for without coming outright.

“Uh-hu. I’ll give you two a minute, but seriously, Bits, forty-eight hours.” She wags a finger at him, and he silently thanks her for her goodness.

Racoon looks at him expectantly.

“I...have someone waiting at home.”

“Okay, so?”

“Well, Jack, I mean Jack from the Falcs? Anyway, he came down to see the game, and he swung on by when I was coming out of Urgent Care–”

“Kid. How the hell do you have this many people–”

“I am a delicate social *butterfly*, Racoon. Isn’t that obvious?” He deadpans, and it has the intended effect, Racoon just laughs at him a little, so he thinks that means they’re okay.

On cue, his phone buzzes, a text from Kenny.

It’s a photo of Jack’s face, his eyebrows squinty.

*Tolerable Asshole: hes all worried about u. Gonna get a lecture, B *\*kissy emoji\*

Racoon rubs a hand over his face, half-ready for optional skate. “Okay. If someone comes to get you, I’ll let you off this time. *But*. I want to reiterate, this doesn’t happen again. You got me, Bittle?”

“I understand. I really didn’t know what to do, and it was late. I’ll take better care.” And he means it. As much as it’s still awkward and so, so *hard* fighting, he still loves what he's doing, wants to stay with the Rebels and have his time on the ice.

“Bittle, we’re a *team*. You took your guys to the East Conference last year, so I *know* you’re a team player. The other guys...I’m going to have some talks, okay. What happened against the Phantoms isn’t fine, and I’m going to address it.”

Bitty sighs a little because this has the potential to make everything worse. “Okay,” he says instead of begging Racoon to just *let it go*. “But, I’ve heard worse, you know that right? They want to call me a fucking faggot on the ice, then that’s fine. I’ve got to take my knocks, well, I expected that, too. It doesn’t change how I’m going to play hockey, and it’s not going to stop me from trying to play the best game I can.”

Racoon’s expression goes neutral, and he nods, just putting a hand on Bitty’s shoulder. “Let me know if Zimmerman can’t pick you up. That’s an order Bittle.”

“Okay,” and he’s already fiddling with what to tell Kenny on their group chat.

*Me: I had to come in and let them see my side. It’s okay, going to head home soon *

*Sweet Summer Child: You should have woken me. I would have driven you.*

Lord, Jack. Like he was really going to do that.

*Me: It’s fine. I think my captain is going to be cross but I’ll get home just fine.*

*Tolerable Asshole: [picture message]*

The photo is of Kenny making bunny ears behind Jack’s head as he drove. They’re already in the car.

Dang it.

*Tolerable Asshole: yeah don’t go anywhere :D*

\*\*

“Your *friends* are Jack Zimmermann and Kent Parson?” Wheelhouse stares at him for long moments and something around the locker room shifts. “That’s why they came to the game last night?”

Bitty just came in to say *hi ya’ll* and pick up his bag.

“Oh, well, yes. It’s the first one both of them have had time to come. Jack was my captain at Samwell, and we’ve been best friends ever since, even before he was on the Falcs,” because rambling might help those side-eyes, “my team went to as many games as we could to support him his first two years, you know? But, I wouldn’t have made this far if it wasn’t for Jack. He helped me get over some things so I could play the best hockey I can. I owe him a lot.” Bitty just shrugs one shoulder, half-smiling at Wheelhouse’s raised brows, “I mean, he came to the game last night to cheer me on. He was happy for me back when Mr. McLean offered me a place here.”

Nickel nudges Dime behind Bitty’s back.

“Kent, well. I met him through Jack, and when we went down to watch one of his games, I baked his team some good luck pies, and some sugar free cookies for Swoops because he’s got diabetes and I felt just *awful* making pies he couldn’t eat, and well. You know, some of the Aces came down to watch the game when we made it to the Eastern Conference last year, and… they’re all such good friends.”

He doesn’t sling his bag on his shoulder, just carries it on his good side.

“Well, I suppose I’ll see ya’ll,” it’s a little sad because *dang it*.

“Yup,” Racoon cuts into the atmosphere, “you rest up and take care of those ribs, Bittle. T said forty-eight hours. Listen to her.”

“You got it. Bye, everyone.”

He walks out feeling eyes on his back, wondering if he just made everything a little better, or so much worse.

\*\*

“You need to *talk to him*, Jack,” and Kenny sighs while Jack drives to the Rebel Arena, “it’s okay if you’re uncomfortable. You want me to talk to him?”

And it comes out softer and unsure because it’s *Kenny*, his Kenny from the Q all grown up, just like it does when it’s Bits looking at him with those eyes, with kind hands that want to do everything to help.

He wonders when he started having a type. Beautiful, hockey-playing blondes that give every piece of their hearts.

Honestly, he doesn’t think it’s a bad thing.

“I appreciate it, you know I do, but I should be the one to do it. I’ve waited a long time to tell him these things, you know, bud?”

“Yeah, I do.”

And a hand pats his knee a few times, starts to pull away, but Jack’s a little faster, just tangles their fingers together. “I still like where you and I are heading. It feels like this has been coming for a while. I know we talked about all that happened before the Draft, and we’ve both said our apologies,” Jack looks over and squeezes his hand, gives him attention now that he’s older and wiser and can understand Kenny better than when they were just fucking *kids* learning about themselves, playing hockey, being away from home with freedom and fuck-ups, and everything in between.

Kenny’s become more precious to him in the last year than ever. Not to mention how much he literally *aches* for Bits sometimes, and Jack’s amazed he can even get through a day without talking to one of them at least.

(*And oh. He might have to think for a while to remember the last time he actually went a day without talking or texting either Bitty or Kent if not both.*)

“And I want you to understand I believe in us this time. We’re both older, smarter this time around I think–”

He laughs softly when Kenny guffaws at him.

“–and I think we both know what we want.”

Kenny leans his head back, looking at Jack’s side profile, and just enjoying his palm wrapped up in that big hand.

As much as it hurts to break this, to hurt himself a little maybe, Kent has to ask the hard question, has to plan around the *what-ifs* (*because he doesn’t know if he can survive losing Jack Zimmermann a second time. That might actually kill him*). It’s awful maybe, selfish, to try and protect himself.

“We both know what we want,” Kenny agrees, “but, there’s nothing we can do until we know what Eric wants. That...might change things, Zimms. And I told you I’m fine if you need to make a decision like that because he might not even be interested in me like that, or–”

He’s cut off when Jack looks at him sharply and pulls into a parking space at the arena. “I thought I was supposed to be the oblivious one, bud.”

“I’m fucking *terrified*, okay? I’m scared. I haven’t wanted anything like this in a long time, and the absolute *best thing* I could ever want is right here, and anything, *anything* can fuck it up, can take it all away, just like that,” and Kenny snaps the fingers of his free hand, looking out the opposite window so he doesn’t have to look at Jack.

“All it takes is Bits to say he doesn’t think of me like that, and yeah. I’m scared, okay?” And Kenny can’t look at those blue eyes when this comes tumbling out. It’s taken them almost two years to get to this point where he’s not thinking carefully about every word before he speaks, where he doesn’t automatically look for signs of a breakdown, of a spiral, signs to pull Jack out of his head with whatever he can use as a distraction.

Two years fighting to become friends again with something more than hockey and fucking to keep them from tearing each other apart, to get over all the pain from being shut out by Jack, by Bob, by Alicia. Two years to believe the *I’m sorry*s and *it was never about you*s. (*He still doesn’t believe it to this day, but it’s nice Jack tried to save his feelings*.)

Two years to get back on the same page again.

Jack awkwardly shuts off the car since he’s not letting go of Kenny’s hand for anything.

He talks to the snapback since his best friend and hopefully soon *significant other or however they call themselves* as Bits said yesterday night, won’t look at him.

“When we came down for your game last year, you didn’t see his face when he danced with you. He was all pink and heavy-eyed, and it wasn’t because of the club.” He makes it smooth, almost a chirp, tugging at Kenny’s hand. “And he calls you *sugar pie*, doesn’t he? Just like he calls me *sweet pea*, and no one else. He bakes for your team and sends them their favorites. He Skypes you wearing his shortest shorts. I think I can recognize the signs, Kenny. I might be oblivious, but in this case, you’re winning.”

A deep sigh and Kent turns to turn, lower lip stuck between his teeth, “he does do those things, doesn’t he?”

“Yeah, bud. He does,” and just because he can, Jack brings their joined hands up, presses his mouth to the top of Kenny’s wrists. “Since he brought it up last night, I’ve got a chance to see if he’s ready for us.”

This time, Kenny’s smile is big and white when he starts laughing, “you are one hundred and ten percent invested in this, Zimms. I’m just...trying to prepare myself for worst case scenario.”

“I’m going to fight like hell for all of us, I promise.”

And the starch in Jack’s spine, the half-smirk is so much charm Kenny can only sigh helplessly, trying to stay tentatively positive.

“Okay. Okay, then. Well, we’re here. Go get our boy before he tries to drive after all.”

“Yes, dear. We’ll see you back at Bitty’s. There’s cookie dough in his freezer if you start getting antsy.”

They get out at the same time, meeting half-way around the car, Kenny looking up at him for long moments, gripping both hands to squeeze in support before climbing in the driver’s seat and easing the SUV back.

Jack gives him a two fingered wave before he heads into the arena, goes right up to the front desk and asks for Eric Bittle.

The lone person behind the ticket counter manning the place with practice probably underway recognizes him immediately, and starts going on about the Falcs. Since she’s dialing down to the locker room, he listens and nods with a smile.

Surprisingly the Falcs and the Rebs haven’t done any joint charity ventures yet this season. Maybe he and Bits can work something out, he thinks while the call is made down to the First-Aid where Bits is probably still at.

Color him surprised when his bud comes walking through, staring down at his phone as usual.

But.

His unsuspecting love walks out from the turnstile gingerly and is wearing a pair of compression leggings and shorts that only hit him mid-thigh, and there’s a moment when he can very clearly imagine the shape of Bitty’s ass in just those leggins, easy access and all.

He takes in a deep breath through his nose.

Just talking.

Make sure Bits stops saying things like *I don’t want to upset anyone*.

Right. He has a plan.

“There you are,” Jack waves a hand at the person on the phone, gives a thumbs-up, and walks around the turnstiles.

Bitty blinks at him, all wide eyes and pink mouth. “Well, at least you’re not giving me your angry face. Now you *know* I had to come on down here, Jack.”

He walks around Bitty pointedly, one finger in the strap of his gear bag, sliding it out of Bitty’s grip while he gets an offended scoff, but no real fight in it.

His other best friend needs to go back to bed with painkillers for a few hours, and Jack doesn’t mind sliding a subtle hand to prompt him on. Taking his longer legs into account, he shortens his strides, pointing out the obvious when they’re away from the ticket counter.

“And you shoulda woke me or Kenny, bud. Remember last night?”

Jack has the satisfaction of catching pink highlighting Bitty’s face, “*yes*. Goodness, I wasn’t that out of it. I figured a night to sleep would be enough time to at least move a little. Spoiler, Jack, it wasn’t.”

It’s easy to take the keys out of Bitty’s hand, steer him to the passenger side, put the bag in the back himself.

“I must have done something good in my past life,” and it’s very appealing how Bitty’s looking at him with half-mast eyes and a small smile, “to have you taking care of me like this.”

Jack leans in to buckle the seatbelt over Bitty’s chest, hand right against the hip.

“Isn’t that what you’ve been doing for me since the minute you moved in the Haus?” *Click*. To make a point...and because he wants to feel the muscle of that thigh shift under his hand in those leggings, Jack pats the side of his leg, pauses to give a brief squeeze.

Then he’s sliding in the driver’s seat of the truck, something similar to the one he drove in Madison when they went to watch the fireworks, laying out on a blanket in the warm, humid air, talking about everything and nothing. Jack’s future in national hockey, Bits wondering if he could even make a bakery go full time, and what else he could possibly do after graduation.

He shifts into gear smoothly.

“I still appreciate you and Kenny coming to watch. Sorry it turned out like this,” and even if he’s slumped a little, Bitty sounds fully awake, and it’s the chance Jack’s been waiting for.

“You know why we came to watch,” he makes it casual, like Bitty’s always known how much they want him. All just so he can get Bitty worked up a little, and yes, Jack Zimmermann knows how to do that, is smiling to himself because this? Is going to work out perfectly for all of them.

“Well, that’s what friends *do*, Jack–”

“That might be true, Bits, but Kenny and I had another reason for coming to town last night. We were hoping you’d have a good win, so we could finally talk.”

He sees Bitty turn in his peripheral, glances over to make sure he’s got that fluttering attention.

“Oh,” is almost too soft to hear, “Jack. I already know about you and Kenny, and, honey,” that smaller hand on his knee just a second before it’s gone, “I mean, you two are really obvious. But you have to know, Jack, that I will absolutely support you two however you need me to. You know that, right?”

“Me and–? Oh, *oh*. That is not at all what I’m trying to tell you.” And Jack lifts his hand off the gear shift, fingers wrapping around the fingers he can reach.

“You need my help sometimes to keep anyone from finding out–?”

“Bits, we need *you*,” and Jack looks over again, watches the confusion spread. “Me and Kenny. We want *you*. Each other, euh, but we want you with us, too.”

“B-but you already have me, Jack. We Skype all the time and hang out and go to games–”

“True. Kenny and I want to add things like kissing, hand-holding, and sleeping in the same bed to all that. Make sense now?”

He glances over at just the right second to catch Bitty’s mouth turn into an “o” of surprise when comprehension finally dawns.

“Are you trying to tell me, you and Kenny want to date me, Jack? Is this…?” Pink immediately spreads over Bitty’s cheeks and down his throat.

“This is me asking you out for both of us because Kenny is terrified you don’t want him. Ah, that you’d do it for me maybe or something.” Jack squeezes the hand in his and moves back to shift the truck into the next gear when he takes the highway. “And neither of us want you to agree if you don’t really want us, you know?”

“Oh...oh* my*,” and a deep breath. Bitty sounds overwhelmed, and Jack patiently waits on him to get over the shock. He has a moment to wonder briefly if maybe Kenny has a point, not sure if that’s just his anxiety brain talking or not.

“I know this might seem like it’s out of nowhere, but to be honest, we’ve been trying to get you to see how much we both want this for a while. When you walked in on us a few nights ago, I didn’t even realize how that looked or what you might have been thinking. Then, last night when you said something about me and him, I finally got it. You didn’t know what we were trying to do.

“Wh-what were you trying to do?” Is soft and breathless, and Jack can see how he’s got a hand splayed over his chest like this is the shock of his life.

“We’ve been trying to show you that we can be good boyfriends to you. We can take care of you just as much as you take care of us. We can be there when you need us, or when you just need someone. We care about you, Bits.” Jack glances over, mouth quirked in a small smile.

“B-but me? *Me*, Jack? We’ve known each other for years now–”

“Bits, you’re the kindest person I know.” And Jack breathes in deeply, the words he’s wanted to say since his graduation day when he finally realized how much this man made his life better, made *him* better, are finally ready to spill out.

It’s time.

“When I started at Samwell, I thought I was there to redeem myself. Try and make-up for those fuck-ups while I was in the Q. And I thought I to do it all on my own, that would be the only way I could forgive myself and move on or something. But, I met our friends, and they didn’t let me do that. I met you, and you didn’t let me do that. And all this time, I thought my life was going to start after I graduated, but the truth is, it started when I met you.”

He knows by the way Bitty’s breath is stuttering beside him there’s tears rolling down his face.

“So... so, this is me laying it out for you, bud.”

It’s soft and shaky when Bits tells him, “Pull over,” in a croak.

A thread of fear, a spike in the part of his brain that houses his anxieties, and Jack wishes he would have taken one of his pills before they left.

“Bits, are you–?”

“Please, Jack,” and that voice is trembling, soft, but Jack can’t look over while he’s gearing down, pulling off to the side of the road. That tone makes something in his chest get tight.

He puts the truck in park, and finally looks over at his best friend, the man he’d fallen in love with years ago, had just been too stubborn to let himself believe it.

“Eric?” because he has this terrifying moment where he thinks he might have gotten everything wrong.

“Do you have any idea how long I’ve been gone for you?” Bitty isn’t looking at him, keeps staring out the window, but Jack sees the way he’s holding himself, hands tight around his biceps, can hear the wet, hoarse quality to his tone.

“And-and it was *fine*, Jack. I was just fine being close to you, being someone you could talk to and depend on. Being your teammate and later your friend. That...that was enough for me because I thought you were straight and there was no way you could have those same feelings for me. I understood that, and I dealt with it alright because I still had you right there beside me.”

Bitty covers his eyes with one hand, his shoulders trembling slightly where he’s trying to keep from splitting open.

“I didn’t think I’d get to have you once you graduated. I thought it was all over, but when it wasn’t, when you kept reaching for me, I was so happy. I was so happy you weren’t just going to be more than just one of my best memories. It wasn’t what I wanted, but it was still so much more than I thought I’d be able to have.”

“Oh, bud,” and Jack’s mouth parts softly, his whole body wanting nothing more than to wrap Bits all up tight, keep him close. “You didn’t know–”

“I was grateful I didn’t have to lose you, Jack, and I’ve been grateful this whole damn time. Good Lord, do you even know how important you are to me?”

And his heart beats hard in his chest for Bitty’s tears and words and love. Hope leaping to something more because Bitty’s wanted him for a long time, too.

“...I think I’m starting to get the picture.”

Sniffling, and oh, Bitty’s sniffling, trying to make it look like he’s not wiping at his eyes when he obviously is, and Jack *can’t stand it*. He pulls up his long legs to maneuver around the shifter. Click his belt and then Bitty’s, his arm eases across the bench seat so he can pull gently, contort himself so he’s got as much of Bitty held against him as he can.

“I thought...I thought I was doing right by you and Kenny.” The sleeve of Bitty’s fleece is damp, his voice still wobbly enough that Jack leans down to lay the side of his face in Bitty’s hair, back-to-chest. “The night of the championship win. I kept everyone from going upstairs so you could have some privacy.”

Jack blinks, “at the Haus?”

“...yeah.”

And *oh*. He remembers stealing upstairs after that game with Lardo where they lost way more money than they should have, but when Bits was still making rounds, accepting congratulations from everyone, he and Kenny had taken the opportunity to steal upstairs, go through Chowder’s room and out onto the roof.

They had talked through some of their issues, but that night was really a turning point for them to getting the friendship they’d once had back again. And Bitty had kept anyone from bothering them, helping them get back on this path, bring them together again, and Jack’s *aches* for this man.

“I...I always wanted you to be happy. Even if it’s not with me, I was fine trying to do what I could for you and Kenny. I-I thought it was easier to bring me along so people wouldn’t suspect you were seeing one another, so you wouldn’t get outed like I did. I didn’t mind, really.”

But the words crack a little, and Jack tries not to hold on too hard because Bitty’s hurt anyway, and he settles for curving around the smaller man as much as he can, nosing against his neck.

“S-so you don’t have to do this. I knew for a while you and Kenny were getting close again, and I’ll still be there if you need someone to take the attention off–”

That bad feeling is back.

“You don’t need to try dating me when that’s not really what either of you want, Jack.”

He turns enough to talk right against the sensitive skin of Bitty’s throat because he’s going to make sure he *never* hears anything like that again out of one Eric R. Bittle.

“You honestly think I would be saying any of this if I didn’t want you, Bits? Or that Kenny would just tag along for the ride?”

“N-no, *no*, I didn’t mean–”

“Then you weren’t listening when I said *we* wanted *you*, were you, bud? When I said Kenny was scared you might not want him back. Maybe...what we’re asking for isn’t there for you. And it’s okay if it’s not!”

“He...Jack, Kenny and I…”

“*Oh*.” Because maybe that’s the case, maybe Bits isn’t ready for them both. “You don’t...for Kenny? I need the truth, Bits.”

“Good *Lord*, have you even met the man? He’s a wonderful mess and I adore him, but he-he can’t want me, Jack. He’s Kent Parson for goodness sake. He loves my food and my sass. And, he likes *you*.”

“I don’t even know how you can think that,” Jack blinks at him like he’s struck, “no, we’ll handle that another time. But Bits, if Kenny wanted more than this from you, from *us*, what would you tell him?”

“Yes,” because even though he’s trying not to just up and ugly cry in front of Jack, he doesn’t have to really think about the question. He’s been crazy about Kenny for almost a year now. “I would tell him yes. Then Lardo would laugh at me, and it would be *awful*.”

“You mean you brought *Lardo* into this? And she didn’t tell me?” There he is, all huffy now.

“Well, I lied and said it wasn’t the two of you, but that doesn’t matter right now.” Because Jack is honestly and truly suggesting the three of them be in a relationship. Together.

He might be a terrible person, but his first thought is to ask whether or not they can have sex immediately because honestly. It’s been what, a year? More? Of dating he didn’t even know about, and he is *ready* to take the next step if this is something he really gets to have.

“Whoa. You told Lards about me *and* Kenny?”

“No,” he comes back snippily, “I said I *lied,* which is why she’s going to laugh at me. There was no other hypothetical crush and my obvious attraction to his boyfriend.”

Jack puts it together in an *ah-ha* moment. Bitty had apparently wanted more for a while, too, and had never said a word. He makes a note to talk about these things later because he’d come out to Bits last year when that ESPN crap happened, so Bitty knew. Bits *knew*. Jack made sure. Kenny chirped the shit out of him later for trying on those shorts, praising the seams for barely containing Jack’s thighs, the ass.

“I can probably guarantee she figured it out anyway, Bits. You are transparent, and Lardo has magical powers of knowing things.”

Normally, he’d get offended, but he’s tired and hurting, so the extra energy just isn’t there, not when Jack feels amazing and warm against his back. “I mean, you’re not wrong.”

The sigh under his arm is followed by a flinch and Jack makes a sympathetic noise, right there with a big chest for him to slouch against and hurt. A long arm winds up his chest, cupping his shoulder, pressing him up so he doesn’t slouch and hurt more. It’s gonna be a chore trying to sleep any kind of way for the next few days.

“Easy, bud. I’ll get you home so you can take your pills, okay?”

“That’s a good plan, I think.”

He slowly turns in the seat, still close enough to smell Jack, all spicy man scent, even catches a few hairs on his scratchy jaw. He thumps his head against the headrest, blinking up at those big blue eyes, and his heart just hitches.

“I told Lardo,” and he makes it soft so Jack pays attention, “that this wonderful man I’ve been mostly in love with finally found someone that made him happy, and that I was having a crisis. It’s awful to be falling for who I thought was my best friend’s boyfriend.”

“Hate to disappoint you, but nah. Me and Kenny haven’t done anything. You walked in one some making out, but that’s it. We were kind of trying to–to, ah.”

Bitty blinks up at him, “what?”

“We were trying to wait for you.”

That is literally the sweetest thing anyone has ever said to him, and his heart just flutters away in his chest, hopeful and happy and anxious and excited. So many things Bitty just sighs up at Jack. It’s tentative when he wraps his fingers around Jack’s, when those fingers squeeze back.

“I don’t think you’ll have to wait too long,” Bitty

“Have you ever thought about it? What it would be like with him...or me?”

And he can’t meet Jack’s eyes because red hot is *not* his side burning. “Once...when we-we went to Vegas. I heard you get up and go to his room…”

“Mmhm,” Jack’s hand is making slow circles across Bitty’s belly, slow relief starting to ease the anxiety. “We just cuddled, but...He did talk about you that night. How it would be if you’d been there between us.”

“O-oh. Jack, that’s– I-I thought you both came last night to tell me you were *together*, not anything like this. I have felt *awful* thinking about the two of you like that.”

“You thought about us. That means things might be looking up.”

“I think I’m in shock,” and even if his side is thumping away, not dull or even distant, it’s still nice to have Jack close now that he *knows*. Lord, this feels good. “I mean, two incredibly hot hockey players at my beck and call. That’s a lot to think about, Jack.”

“You don’t have to give me an answer now, Bits. If you need to think about it–”

And Bitty turns too fast, jerks himself the wrong way and freezes with a whimper, hands going immediately to his wrapped ribs.

He groans once he can get a *breath* because *yup, that smarts*. “Jaques Laurent *Zimmermann*,” and the tone of his voice makes Jack go rigid beside him, “if you think for one single, solitary *second* I need to think about whether or not I want more than this, then *you, Sir*, are out of your *mind*.”

He feels Jack jerk a little in surprise, so he tilts his head far enough back that he can see how wide those blue eyes are, how Jack is worrying his lower lip between his teeth.

“I can really have this is what you’re tellin’ me, isn’t it, sweet pea?” He makes it gentle as possible while he’s still hurting pretty good. “That we can make it work?”

And *oh*. That’s massively unfair because Jack laughs softly and his whole expression changes into something so nice and fond, and Bitty gets the press of Jack’s mouth on his forehead.

“As long as you tell Kenny to stop being an idiot, I think we’re all in.”

But honestly, it won’t be the first time he’s told Kenny that, so he thinks they might all have a shot.

Jack helps buckle him in again, and the atmosphere in the truck changes just a little more when Jack’s smile is less fond and more...something *else*. Something that makes Bitty’s throat a little dry and his heart beat a little faster.

He’s not so naive to these things because, honestly, he has the internet. Who hasn’t watched porn? So he can recognize the look of someone picturing you without your clothes on, but the fact it’s a look on Jack’s face is what makes him very glad they had this conversation.

\*\*

When they come in the front door, Jack goes into his living room, turns on the television pointedly, and leaves Bitty to get his answers.

He, in fact, finds a very handsome man making cookies and dancing in his kitchen, and *Lord* does it take his breath away.

With the music blaring, Kenny didn’t hear the door open, and is getting it while he bends over to check on the second batch.

But *no*. Bitty is here for *answers*, dang it. There’s something incredible dangling right in front of him, something he didn’t know could happen, and he needs to have some pretty clear boundaries and explanations with one Mister Kenneth Virgil Parson.

The *Third*.

He thumbs the bluetooth speaker, turns the music slowly down until those gray eyes come up and see him standing by his table.

“Hi, sugar pie,” rolls right out of his mouth, all easy and soft.

“*Bits*,” and goodness sake, it’s so much mother-henning for about fifteen minutes solid. Kenny is all up in his personal space, one hand on Bitty’s hip like he didn’t even have to think about it. Somewhere in there is something about taking care of himself because he’s a professional athlete now and all, then how it wasn’t fair Bitty was gone before morning cuddles and what did his trainers say about his side? Did they give him something for the pain? Do one of them need to go to a pharmacy because they can do that, B, and you should be laying down–

But it’s so much worry and care that Bitty’s heart swells up for a minute when he finally realizes this is how Kenny shows himself, and it gives Bitty just enough courage to take that crazy step forward and slide the hand he can raise up around the back of Kenny’s neck. He doesn’t have to go so far up on his toes, doesn’t really feel the sting in his side when he presses his mouth to Kenny’s and shuts this boy right the heck on up.

The oven mitt falls, and it’s both hands on him now, Kenny pressing closer instead of pulling back, saying they shouldn’t do this because he’s with Jack or he isn’t interested, doesn’t see Bitty that way.

Instead, Kenny makes a soft noise against his mouth, hands palming his face to hold him still, and *goodness*, it’s so much more than that time at the Winter Screw. It’s hot and wet and *perfect*. His mouth is soft and sweet and the things he’s doing with his tongue makes Bitty’s knees so weak. It might have been a never-ending kiss, or they might have pulled back just to come together again, but his mouth is tender when the sound of the oven opening is the thing that shakes him from this hazy feeling of Kenny’s mouth.

Jack had swiped the oven mitt off the floor and put the cookies on top the stove. He’s already boosted himself up on the counter, his grin downright *dirty* while he watches.

“Don’t let me stop you,” when Kenny’s just staring down at him, not letting go of his face, both of them panting like they’d just run suicides. “You’re beautiful together.”

“You hear him, B?” And Kenny’s voice sounds *wrecked*, and just! Bitty’s the one that did that to him, now didn’t he?

“I heard,” he has to swallow and try again, licking his puffy lips, drawing Kenny’s eyes, “I heard something about not stopping, I think.”

## Game Day

The more he thinks about it, the more nervous he gets, but with fierce determination, Bitty uses the fact most the people working the ticket counter already know him to get into the Falc’s Arena early.

He knows Jack is taking an hour in the team’s quiet room to relax before jumping into his pre-game rituals.

He’s already texting Jack how to get to the Snapchat map to find Bitty’s location.

*Me: You might be surprised where I'm at right now ;)*

*Sweet Summer Child: ...*

*Sweet Summer Child: Does X mark the spot?*

*Me: You wanna come and find out?*

The luck of the hockey gods is indeed smiling down on them because not a few minutes after he snuck in the deserted bathroom is the door squeaking open, and he can see yellow running shoes under the door.

“Bits?”

He cracks the door to see Jack with his phone in his hand and makes a *hurry up* motion.

## Skyping with Kent: talking about the obvious *pining*.

“You mean you really didn’t *know*?”

Oh sweetheart, how could he have?

Bitty is watching Kent move around his kitchen making himself dinner while they Skype. The time difference is something they’ve had to work out, but it’s fine. Bitty doesn’t need a nap today anyhow.

“I...I thought you and Jack were datin’ again.” He starts in his defense, “and it helped throw people off of y’all when you brought me along.”

Kent actually pauses where he’s mixing brussel sprouts in a vinaigrette sauce to look at the screen (safely out of the way of his mess), “you thought *what*?”

Bitty turns away from the laptop screen, pushing his face into some pillows where he’s resting, “it made sense, I swear.”

“I mean, Jack told you about us, right? Me and him?”

“N-not in so many words, darlin’, and I didn’t feel like it was my place to pry. I thought Jack was just...being a good friend is all.”

“Bitty, he brought you to meet the Falcs.”

“But, I made them pie!”

“He has a room for you in his apartment.”

“No, no. He has a *guest* room.”

“Even his senior year, you didn’t suspect he had feelings for you?”

“He was always so busy, Kenny.”

Those grey eyes lighten when Kent laughs a little, “wow. I’m amazed, Bits. Like, I know how *bad* Jack is with the whole feelings thing, but I didn’t know he was *that* bad.”

Bitty just shrugs, “I thought he was straight, you know. Even with the rumors ‘bout y’all, I didn’t want to assume.”

\*\*

## Kenny and Bits

It’s very cute when Kenny wants to cook for him.

Well, it’s more of a seduction honestly because Kent Parson is well-aware one Eric R. Bittle has a kink for competent men in the kitchen.

(*Not even to mention it’s Kenny, and Lord did they do naughty things most of last night without having actual sex. The playoff season is coming up on them fast as can be, so they’ve still got months before all three of them can be in the same place at the same time. It’s awful, the waiting, but he never even *knew* how many other things they could do without...going all the way. But he really can’t complain too much because Jack and Kenny are intent on teaching him *everything* there is.*)

So he gets to sit at the very nice table and watch one of his men move around with the cutest ass bopping along with the apron tie right above drawing Bitty’s eye every darn time.

Kit purrs in his arms like she’s agreeing with him. This human is something *special*.

“...and then Hammie was taking the kids on their first suicide, and they were so *awesome*, B. Just! I can see the next generation of hockey greats in them, okay?” Pause as Kenny actually looks over his shoulder and, “oh! *Bits*, are you staring?!”

The tone is what shakes Bitty, his eyes snapping up to Kent’s, and his face goes immediately red.

“You totally were!” Kent gives a grinning fist pump before jumping right in Bitty’s space and hauling him up for a laughing kiss. “You were *oogling* my backside, weren’t you B?”

“Well, it’s an awfully nice backside, Kenny,” Bitty mumbles against his mouth.

“I like that. I like that a *lot*.”

“I figure so from the man that gave me underwear with his *own name* on the ass.”

“Please, please tell me you brought those.”

“Well, I might just be wearin’ ‘em right now, Mister Parson. Guess you’ll have ta wait n’ see *after dinner.*” Followed by a little wave for Kent to get back to what he was doing, which should be making them a nice meal where Bitty can watch him bend over and crouch down and...*Lord*, he can’t believe he’s thinking these things already. And in the kitchen for heaven’s sake.

And just that Southern *sass* makes Kent shudder with every inch of him ready to throw Bits up on his table and *ruin* him.

(After playoffs. Him and Jack on their Eric is going to be the hottest thing to *Ever. Happen.* He and Jack are going to *wreck this sweet Southern child*.)

So Kent gives himself massive points for just kissing the tip of Bitty’s pink nose and going back to prepping for dinner, now looking very forward to play time later tonight.

His game is two nights from now, so plenty of time to prep, plan, pull it together, and have one of his favorite people in the stands at the same time.

(*They are going to have amazing victory sex, and he’s already talked to Jack about having the night off to Skype with them while he takes their Bitty down to begging. Jack’s eyes got dark and he gave that little smirk, “sounds like a good night, Kenny. The two of you together are...beautiful.”* *And that? Means more to him than he could ever tell either of them*.)

He gets into Hockey Talk to divert them and clear out some of the UST, starts babbling about Swoops and Scrappy with the kid’s again, making sure to put more shimmy in his hips, bending over to get a casserole dish for the potatoes and zucchini.

“I’m glad you had a good time with your boys, honey,” is soft and fond in a way Bitty is with Jack and makes Kent smile where he’s cutting the fresh salmon and letting the pan on the stove warm. “I always stalk your Insta, so I think my favorite is you holding the little girl’s hands on those quote, unquote *suicides*.”

He grins wider. “Aw, you’re the kind of stalker I like.”

“Mm. It’s cute how you think I don’t see right through you, Sir. You act like the devil, but you’re really just a fallen angel in disguise.”

And just *oh, Bits*.

Kent pretends his fish overmits are *super* *sexy*, and turns to pose by the stove, puts on an act while his heart is literally beating in the back of his mouth for this boy. “Think you have me all figured me out, Bittle?”

“I am very good at gathering evidence, Mister Parson.”

“Oh? Going to be a detective now, Bits?”

Bitty arches a brow at him, the cute smirk that’s really going to get him in trouble some day right there on Kent’s face. He stands up slowly, already raising his hands to start ticking off some fingers.

“Well, sugar pie, I know you do clinics for kids once a month at least, make food for your team, check up on ‘em, just like a good captain should. I know your cat is literally your other half, and I fully accept that as your boyfriend.” He’s taking steps forward to put them together, chest-to-chest, while the salmon lightly cooks behind them. “I *could* go on about all the charity works you don’t get recognized for, or the way you pull your Rookies up when they need you. I could go on about how cute your feud with Kim Kardashian is and how it makes my black lil’ heart happy.”

And Kent’s looking down into those eyes and that very gentle expression on Eric’s face, and just *God*, he’s something more.

The hand on his scratchy jaw, directing him down for a kiss on the forehead. “You’re a good man, Kenneth Virgil Parson. Don’t let anybody tell you different.”

Kent sighs and he wonders if he actually looks like that heart eye emoji. Because wow does he feel it.

“You really are sunshine, Bits. Literal sunshine. How can you still be in Pawtucket? I mean, I *know* some people have been going to your games. NHL Scouts. Like, I’m *aware*, okay? I don’t talk about it–”

And the way Bitty’s face drops, his eyes skitter away, Kent thinks it maybe, *maybe* might be time for that little conversation.

(Because he and Jack *talked* about it. A few different times, especially after that dislocated rib fiasco that scared the hell out of both of them.)

“I ah, I mean, well,” and his eyes come back to Kent’s, “is it. Is it...okay if I talk to you about hockey? Without you, *you know*, wantin’ to jump in and save the day? I just, I don’t need that, honey, do you understand? It ain’t about you, just like I’ve been sayin’ and I *mean it*.”

Kent takes in a deep breath, some things now making more sense, and turns back to the stove to flip the fish and use the other half of the lemon to drip juice for a nice sizzle.

“Just for the record, you can *always* talk to me about hockey, Bits. It’s what we *do*, and you’re still in your first year of a professional sport free of the academic support. There’s more pressure at this level, so *yes*, *babe*, please talk to me about hockey.”

He turns back to find Bitty with an arm full of Kit, sitting back down at the table, shoulders curving in a little.

“That being said. Jack and I have both been...concerned you won’t tell us much about playing for the Rebels. You’re not billeting with a team member. You’ve had two pretty hard injuries already, which is kind of normal for a Rookie, but we’re not *blind*, Bits. We see what your team is doing.”

“Kenny–”

And it’s so small and vulnerable that his heart gives a hard beat. He takes the fish off the fire, lets it cool while the vegetables cook. And then he’s kneeling down in his fave apron, fish mitt on one hand, bending down to look up at Bitty’s face.

“You said this was *your fight*, and when it comes to the NHL, that can be mine and Jack’s fight, that you thought of this as paving the way. But many more injuries like this, and someone needs to get involved. Wouldn’t it be better to talk to us about it first?”

“Lord no. Please don’t tell any of this to Jack,” Bitty moans, covering his eyes with one hand while Kit literally puts a paw delicately on his chest.

“You have no idea how crazy this is making him. Seriously, Bits, he bitches and moans about it constantly.”

“What are you even talking about, honey?”

Kent pats his boy’s knee with Fish and straightens up, tugs and pulls until Kit is puttering around the table and Bitty is nestled up against him, still tense about the conversation he does *not* want to have, thank-you very much. He came all the way to Las Vegas to enjoy his boyfriend, cheer him on, and maybe go dancin’ or out to have a nice dinner.

He didn’t want to talk about what he’d be going home to.

“Jack, our Jack. Mister *Hockey is a way of life* is upset you won’t talk about your team or your games. You know he reviews your tapes just as much as mine and his own, right?”

“Please don’t tell me these things, Kenny.” Burying his face in Kenny’s chest isn’t going to help either of them, but he still tries, dang it.

“It’s true. That’s just Jack, and like, he kind of expects you to come to him and tell him all about it? And it freaks him out that you don’t.”

“He’s got enough on his plate with the Falcs–”

“Which is absolute bullshit and we both know it.”

The silence just makes him hug tighter, nuzzle against Bitty’s ear, which is a total exploitation of his boyfriend’s weakness. He’ll atone later in bed.

*Promise.*

“Eric. Talk to me, babe. I’m here for you, okay?”

The sigh against him means he’s won for now.

“Jack was my captain at Samwell for two years, Kenny. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for him, you know? I can’t even tell you what a saint that boy was back then, gettin’ up every morning for checking clinics an’ supportin’ me when I thought I wouldn’t have any choice but to quit and go back home to Madison. Jack helped me be strong enough to come this far, to get me through the to ECAC, and I don’t want him to see me…I-I just need to see this through on my own. I’ve got to be able to stand on my own. They might be tough, but I’m tougher.”

“Bits,” Kenny tosses Fish and runs his fingers through Bitty’s hair, nails skritching lightly. “Babe, you are putting too much pressure on yourself and Jack. He’s already so proud of you just for being *you*.”

And he feels Bitty’s mouth pull in a little moue against his shoulder, knows the pout is there, and noses his face up so Kent can kiss it away. “I can’t promise we’re not going to get mad on your behalf, or that we won’t step in if shit starts getting *real*. Like, we’re not going to be fine with you working up to permanent injuries because your D-Men don’t have your back. Bitty, you need to understand how not *fine* this is, okay?”

The eyes dart away again, and just when he feels frustration welling up at things he can’t step in and help *fix*, he finally gets it.

(*“You should know Bitty has your Rookie poster in his room in Madison,” Jack said one night when they were getting back on track to being friends. “I thought it was...cute.”*)

(“*Jack was my captain at Samwell.” “You’re a good captain, honey.”*)

“Oh,” is a moment of clarity, and he bends down far enough to kiss Bitty’s forehead, his nose, and a chaste one on his mouth. “Eric, Bitty, *Bits*. I **want** to know everything, and I want you to be comfortable coming to me with this stuff, and I know *for a fact*, Jack will say the same thing.”

That little bit of pink heating those cheeks is adorable, and Kent really hadn’t considered maybe Bitty just thought something absolutely *insane* like Jack and Kent’s NHL careers were more important or that he didn't want to *bother them* with his problems because so much Southern influence at keeping a public face. He’d thought maybe Bits didn’t trust him yet, but when Jack admitted Bitty hadn’t come to him to talk hockey either and about what was going on with his team, well, he didn’t know what to think.

But, he hopes this might be the starting point, and if it is, Jack can finally *calm it down*.

“...all right.” And a deep breath, eyes fluttering closed, “all right, then. Wh-where do you want me to start?”

His voice is so small, Kent feels momentarily bad, wants to wrap his arms tighter around Bitty and keep him from looking so tired and a little defeated.

He sits his boyfriend back down at the table to let Kit meander back to them and scuttle to lay around Bitty’s shoulders with her tail whapping him in the face every so often.

He helps by keeping busy, takes the pan out of the oven and drizzles his vinaigrette sauce over the mixture, puts it back in with some more spices this time around for everything to get nice and golden.

He listens carefully to the way Bitty starts out with, “They...they didn’t eat my pie,” like the fact absolutely kills him to this day, is one of the *worst* things that could have ever happened.

And Kent already wants to visciously murder every person on the Rebels. With his bare hands. But, he’s going to *try*, he’s going to try so, so hard for Bits to just listen and not start yelling. He’s going to try to be totally supportive and just let Bitty talk about everything he needs to and fill in a lot of those gaps in the last few months.

“But we had a few good preseason activities and I thought things were fine! Nickel an’ Dime are right nice when they talk, but after Mr. Cannon came back to the locker room and talked to me, they’ve been frowning something fierce, and I just don’t know *why*. I don’t know what I did other than say *no thanks*.”

“Wow, I mean, Cannon is a *big deal*, Bits, and from their perspective, you’re a Rookie. Sure, you’re fast and you have incredible instincts, and *probably* should have been NHL from the start, but they’re assuming he’s trying to recruit you for the next Draft. For guys that have made a career out of the AHL, it might be hard to deal with a young guy just getting ahead.”

“But that’s just silly and I told him so, Kenny! I was nicer than that because a’ who he *is*, but I told him I wasn’t ready to leave the AHL just yet. I needed some time to get my feet under me. A couple seasons maybe.”

He sighs, petting Kit while Kent plates everything up.

“Then we had a really good practice, a good game! We won! And it was amazing! Butchy even told me his wife likes my cookies, and that’s so nice, honey! I thought I was getting somewhere *again*.”

“But then Mario Lemieux came to one games, and they were all mad at me again!”

“Wait, Mario Lemieux from the Pittsburgh Penguins?”

Now he’s thinking about having a whole different conversation with Jack. Both of them had pretty much assumed once it came time for Bitty to move to the NHL, he would choose the Aces or the Falc. Another team trying to recruit him under their noses hadn’t played into this scenario.

“Well, yes, honey. He’s such a wonderful man. He talked up a few of his old games and sat next to me while I got my skates off.”

Kent literally has to pause because how is their Bitty this *pure*.

“He gave me his card and said I should call him sometime, which just about put me on the *floor*, I tell you, but I did say I would call for tickets the next time I’m in town, but *honestly*, he just patted me on the shoulder a lot to tell you the truth.”

Yup, going to have a conversation with Jack if the Penguins are after their boy. There is no way either of them are going to be okay with Bitty on the East Coast, farther away from them. That just *can’t happen*.

“But Kenny, it just started all over again! That game with the Marlies…” and Bitty sighs because he was wearing ice packs on his hips for two days afterwards.

“And then, I thought we were getting somewhere again! I went out with them and talked it up, and they were all nice as can be the next game, but I went out and visited Jack and–”

The rambling comes to a quick close when Bitty’s face goes eerily still. “They always get surly after I’ve been with the Falcs or the Aces. Oh, oh! And that one time Wayne Palmer from the Kings came to one of our games!” But then, the lightbulb really goes off. “My *Lord*, that explains it!”

“Okay. Fill it in for the rest of the class, please.”

But Bitty is up and pacing already, thinking out loud, “you said it yourself, honey. They think I’m fixing to go to the NHL or some other team or something! Well. I’m just gonna have to nip that right in the bud the second I get back. And *dammit*, I am going to make *pie*, and they are going to *eat it*.”

Biting his lips together so he doesn’t make kissy faces at how *cute* Bits is right now, his face all stern, just like that picture Jack has of the EACA and Captain Bitty stepping out on the ice for what would be his last college game.

“Sounds like you have a plan, Bits. You can hash out the details after you’ve eaten this amazing food I’ve made for you.”

He puts a plate down in front of his boyfriend and leans down to kiss his nose again. He picks up Kit off Bitty and shoos her to her own bowl where he opens a can of wet food and she mews up at him in appreciation.

He gets his own plate, fills Bitty’s glass with wine while he drinks water, sticking to his pregame regime of no alcohol. He’s not nineteen anymore, and a career like theirs means a *lot* of smart self-care.

They eat in companionable silence when Kent finally comes out with it, “are you okay if I...ask some questions?”

Bitty blinks at him mid-moan at how *good* the fish turned out, “of course, honey. I’ll do my best to answer. How’s that?”

“Fair enough,” he takes a drink to steady himself for it, to make sure Bitty can see he’s serious, “are you really considering another team? In any way shape or form?”

“Oh honey, no. No, I’m really not.”

“Before you do anything, you’ll talk to me and Jack, right? If you ever start thinking about it, we need to have that conversation.”

“Yes, Kenny. I will,” Bitty promises, smiling in that soft, fond way again.

“Okay, thank-you. And to make sure you understand–” Kent brandishes his fork “–Jack and I *both* want you to start talking to us about everything, Bits. No more hiding.”

“No, no, Kenny, don’t think– *honey*, I wasn’t hiding things I swear.”

“You probably didn’t intend to, but you kept us in the dark about what you were going through, and finding out by watching your games and, gee, finding you asleep in your *truck* just made us both more anxious at what was going on. Jack was a mess after we found you, you know.”

“I didn’t want to worry anyone.”

“I *know*, babe, but by trying ‘not to worry us,’ you worried us even more. Just let me emphasize, we are in a relationship with you. We are also in the same industry, facing the same pressure, so of course we want you to come to us with everything, okay? Am I saying this right? Crap, Jack could say it better, hold on and let me FaceTime him. Just, hold on a minute–”

“Stop! You crazy man, sit down and eat this amazing dinner. You are doing just fine on your own.” And Bitty smiles at him again, soft and sweet, reaching across the table for Kent’s hand, making him flop back down in his chair and grab on.

“Thank-you, Kenny. I really think I needed to hear that.”

Relief strikes him hard in the chest, and he feels like he can get a full *breath*. “Good. I’m sorry I’m terrible at these things sometimes, but if you stick with me, I’ll eventually get it right, Bits.”

The laugh is soft, Bitty’s face wrinkling up in mirth, “oh honey, I’m good right where I am. Haven’t you figured that out yet?”

\*\*

When he absolutely means to call Jack for the purposes of spilling what happened this evening while Bitty’s taking a shower, he instead calls Jack to be there waiting for Kent to pull a wet, naked Bitty right out of the bathroom to dump him on the California King where Jack can see *everything*.

And this? Jack in the background, making his own type of noises as the soundtrack to Bitty’s keening cries, the absolute *taste* of him, the feel of him is just so much hotter than his brain could have ever come up with.

Kent has no idea how he’s going to survive until the offseason when the three of them can be in the same place at the same time.

“How many times did you make him come with your mouth?” Kent asks conversationally when he can pull back from fucking his tongue inside to make their boy’s thighs *quake*.

“In a row?” Jack moans out, “twice.”

“Then we’re going for three, aren’t we Bits?”

“I-I-I don’t know if I *can*, oh my *Gawd*, Kenny. What are you *doing* to me?”

Fists are clenched in his sheets, Bitty’s nice and pink down to his chest, hips rocking against Kent’s face, needy and so *pretty*.

“Aw, I bet you can,” he purrs, kissing a trembly thigh over his shoulder. He looks over at the laptop screen set-up on the window sill so Jack can get the full view. “You think he can take it, Jack?”

And those blue, blue eyes are so dark, their wonderfully massive boyfriend pretty horizontal with his cock in his hand while he watches them. “Tell you what, Kenny,” Jack’s voice is deep and gruff, his mouth puffy from biting down on his lip, “what you do to Bitty tonight, I’ll do to you after your game next month, eh? Then he can watch you squirm under my mouth, too.”

Kent goes hot all over, his dick already hard enough to make a hole in the box spring for fuck’s sake. Is Jack *trying* to kill him?

“Deal,” he rasps, “guess Bits is going to get his revenge.”

“That’s going to be so hot,” the youngest groans out, forearm over his eyes, “just because you’re not going to fuck *me* absolutely does *not* mean you can’t fuck each other for my enjoyment. Just throwing it –*oh, oh, oh, Kenny, Good Lord!*”

“Euh, he was thinking too clearly.”

“Mm. He needs to come again, Zimms, just listen to him.”

“Get ‘im, bud. Make him yell.”

\*

But it’s really *all* part of Kent’s master plan from the get-go. From getting Bitty to finally open up about the AHL to properly romancing him with a nice dinner and time together, to fucking *phenomenal* sex, to Bits just pretty much unconscious all over him from coming his brains out.

All so he and Jack can *talk* about today.

And so he can get snuggles.

Perfect plan perfectly executed. *That* is the Parson way.

The laptop migrated to the bedside table from post-sex clean-up and hydration, teeth brushing, and cuddling while they talked with Jack. So when Bitty finally passes out, Jack is right there with narrowed eyes, snuggled in his own bed, messy hair all over the place.

“Everything all right, Kenny?” In soft Québécois.

When he sighs, Bitty moves with the motion of his chest, and even if it’s been years since Québécois rolled off his tongue, Kent answers back the same, “I’ll talk a little about it if you promise me you won’t try to do anything but just listen, okay? Jack, do you think you can do that?”

Of course Jack doesn’t make that promise, not like Kenny didn’t know better, so he roughly outlines the situation with Bits, and that maybe they could make *more* of an effort to ask about how it’s going with the Rebels and get a little more involved instead of backing off like they have been.

“So, it looks like it’s about other teams trying to recruit him than him being out?” Jack’s eyebrows are twitching and his sour look is one Kent recognizes on a whole different level.

He tries to shrug as best he can with a mini hockey player sleeping on his chest, “looks like it to me, or well, Bits. He’s the one that kind of put all that together.”

“We were at that game. The Phantoms–”

“I know, Jack.”

“They could have thought we were–”

“I *know*, Jack.”

Some garbled something Kent recognizes from their time in the Q, and he can’t help but chuckle just a little because there’s always those familiar things, comfortable things.

Even if it’s swearing Alicia would have rinsed Jack’s mouth out for even uttering.

“He might have taken that check because of us.”

“Maybe. But, there’s no use beating ourselves up about it. We didn’t know, and he wasn’t talking to us. Hopefully, it’ll be better now that he understands we *want* to know.”

“You’re a miracle worker.”

“We’re captains, Jack. We need to be able to talk about shit other than hockey.”

“...emotions are hard, but yeah. Yeah, I know you’re right. I kind of fucked up this time.”

“You’re in your third year, give yourself some slack. What we need to focus on is that we know *now*, and we know how we can help. Sometimes he just needs to vent,” another shrug because, whatever. The Bitty code is cracked and they’re going to step it up for their boyfriend now. Simple as that.

“Yeah, okay. Mmhm. Look at you being all grown-up, Captain Parson.”

“Why thank-you Alternate Captain Zimmermann. It’s called *The Key to Good Relationships is Communication*.”

“Sounds like you’re the one together in this relationship. Good thing.”

“That is absolutely *not true*. All three of us are hot messes. That’s part of why we work so well.”

“More evidence another time.”

“Agreed. But! It’s easier to manage someone else’s mess than your own, so that’s how.”

“I see. After your next away, I’m going to manage your mess just fine, Parse.”

“I’m banking on it, Zimms.” He makes kissy noises before he hangs up for the night, still chuckling while he cuddles Bitty more. As he finally drifts off, things seeming a little more in their favor.

\*

Kent wanders down the away corridor, confused why Bitty would be *here* of all places.

The stadium doesn’t even open for another hour, and by that time, Kent will be in his pre-game ritual (*which Bitty knows*).

“Hello? B?” His voice echoes around the empty bathroom, and the creaking of the stall at the end draws his immediate attention.

A pink-face Rebel is peeking at him around the door. “*Sshhh!*” Bitty hisses with a rolling *come over here* hand.

“Oh!” He lowers his voice, “oh, hey! You’re here alre–”

Bitty snags him by his jersey and pulls him in, pushing Kent up against the wall while he closes the door and locks it.

It’s probably a little too hot that Bits has a hand over Kent’s mouth, but he will really focus on this later.

(*He’s glad he’s already out of his pre and post game suit, in his jersey and jeans instead because this? Has so much promise, and he really doesn’t want a tie or too many buttons in the way.*)

When his smaller boyfriend looks up at him from under the brim of the Aces snapback, teeth glinting in a wide smile, Kent gets the feeling he might be getting a kiss (*or a possibly hot makeout session*) for good luck.

What he gets is his pants shoved down and Bitty down on his knees, sucking him off until Kent has to bite on his fist to keep from yelling when he comes.

“Holy *shit*, Bits,” he gives himself a second, watches Bitty pull out wet wipes and a water bottle from his backpack. The bold *Parson* across his shoulders with Kent’s number on him is really just the icing on the cake.

His brain fuzzes more at how *prepared* Bitty is for this, wiping him off and offering him a drink of water.

“Thought I might try to give you some good luck, sugar pie,” Bitty is absolutely smirking his smirkiest smirk because he just gave a Stanley Cup winner a blow job before a game in his own home stadium. That? Is really going above and beyond.

“We’re going to win by a mile, and I am going to *wreck you* once it’s over,” Kent finally stirs, groaning with the residual tingling in his balls.

“I’m looking forward to it,” Bitty winks and slides the round lock on the door, already sneaking out of the stall. “Have a good game, honey. I’ll see you after.”

Kent says, “thanks, Bits,” when what he really wants to say is *I love you*.

\*

Turns out lucky blow jobs really do make a difference (*or so Bitty will claim*) because the Aces really cleaned up. Not that Bitty doubted them for a second because the team just beats the pants off the Schooners any day of the week, bless their hearts. He doesn’t have to be *in* the actual NHL to know that.

Still, he’s close enough to the ice to see Kenny up close when he takes a beginning lap to wave to the fans on their home turf and start getting everyone riled up for the game.

Bitty doesn’t know if Kent sees him in the crowd because those lights are *so *bright, but he does catch the Captain smiling awful big when he comes around Bitty’s part of the arena.

After most the crowd leaves, Bitty’s hanging around outside, answers messages on his YouTube channel from last week’s “Pâte Brisée, Pâte Sucrée, and Pâte Sablée: Know Your Crust!” episode.

As usual, *Profess\_BkerBoi* has something to say about his breakdown this week and if that ain’t just frustrating as all get out.

The noise picks up for a minute or two, and that’s his boy (*one of his boys, Lord what’s his life right now?*) walking out with his team, probably riding the victory high. His phone buzzes in his hand where he was still debating on whether or not to give in to the trolls.

Kenny’s message *where u at?* Makes him laugh just a little.

*Outside the entrance watching the traffic :D take your time*

He doesn’t just hit send when the team spills out of the stadium, talking it up and chirping like mad. Swoops and Nutty saw him when he straightened, hard to miss in his Parson jersey.

“Hey! Bits! Coming up from the A’s to come see us?”

“Those cookies were for real, man.”

“Nice of you to think ahead and make us *victory* cookies, Bitty!”

Slightly embarrassed, he waves a *go on, now* hand and absolutely tells them his cookies are *made* for winners anyhow.

It’s nice how he gets most the team slapping him on the back, looking genuinely glad to see him again. He gets a selfie with as many as he could fit in the frame, the glowing neon signs in the background.

Twitter might just break with how wide Kent is smiling beside him, arm around his waist with Swoops kissing Kent’s cheek on the other side.

The team is fixing to meet up at one of their normal clubs on the Strip to celebrate the win. And even though he’s close enough with the Aces to make them good luck cookies and pies, to chirp them on Twitter and send messages, he’s not sure if he should intrude on their good time.

“All right, fearless leader. You drop your stuff at home and meet us at the bar.”

“Ah, well,” Kent scratches the back of his neck, “Bitty’s only in town for a few more days, guys–”

“He’s coming too, geeze, Parse! Like we want your ass without him.”

“Oh, I don’t want to intrude. Kent can just drop me at my hotel–” of course he means Kenny’s house, which is where he’s been staying.

“What? The guy that made us victory cookies?! Seriously? You’re practically part of the team, Bits.”

And well, that’s just right nice of them, isn’t it?

Before he argues back, he’s suddenly in Kent’s ridiculous car with his backpack already in the back seat.

“I’m sorry, honey–” he starts, but Kent steamrolls right over him.

“Do you not want to go out? We can stay in if–”

“Oh no, no! Kenny, I don’t want to intrude on your team’s win! I know how you are with your boys.”

“Well, I mean, yeah. They’re my guys, but so are you? They know you’re visiting, so it’s totally cool to go out with us. Don’t even try to tell me you don’t want to get your dance on.”

“I’ll have you know I am always ready to tear up the dance floor with you, Mister Parson.”

“Well, I guess we’re going to go out then, aren’t we *Mister Bittle*.”

And well, if he’s smiling out the window, no one but the nice lady in the minivan next to them will ever know.

\*\*

Kenny throws his bag down in the hallway and scoops up Kit for a nuzzle. Bitty follows behind, smile still in place, and unloads his backpack on the kitchen table. He automatically checks Kit’s food bowl and gasps in outrage as he finds it empty.

The bag of kitten chow is under the island, so he fills it without really thinking about it. Instead, he’s wondering what he’s going to wear out on a night on the town with (*Oh Lord*) his undercover boyfriend and his boyfriend’s teammates because he doesn’t want to get *too *hot while they’re dancing–

Arms around his waist and a warm mouth at the back of his neck derail his train of thought slightly.

“Before we get changed,” hotly in Bitty’s ear. “I want to hit you back for that pre-game meet-up. You totally helped cement the win with your superior blow job skills.”

Bitty laughs a little, “Why, that’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me, Kenny, but we’re gonna have to be fast about it, or your team is gonna suspect something’s up.”

“Bits, the important guys already know about me, so it’s not a big deal.”

“Oh, well good. That means I can peel you right outta this very nice suit, hm?”

“Actually, no it doesn’t,” and Kenny is grinning at him, already reaching out to slide an arm under his butt and just lift him right off his feet.

Land’s sake, this boy.

“Kenny! You just played a *game* for heaven’s sake!”

But the Captain of the Aces isn’t paying him one bit of attention, is instead leaning his face in to run the tip of his tongue over the spot on Bitty’s neck to make him shiver.

“The day I can’t carry you to bed is the day I give up hockey, Itty Bitty,” Kent breathes against his throat, doing an about-face on just his heels.

“I will never, upon my dying day, admit I said this out loud,” Bitty hooks his ankles together at the small of Kent’s back and grips those hips with his thighs, “but this is probably the hottest thing in the *world*.”

They’re moving through the house and down the hall, Kent carrying him like he’s a duffle bag for all the effort. “Yeah? I’m very glad to hear that. I’m probably going to be carrying you everywhere from now on. All you’ll have to do is hold on.”

The laugh coming out of Bitty is softer than he meant it to be because *Lord, Kenny, he’s going to hold on with both arms and hope none of it blows up in his face*.

\*

The sex is quick and dirty, Kenny stripping him out of his clothes until–

The only thing left is the men’s sports briefs. With *Parson* written right over Bitty’s ass and the number inside a playing card is right there on his hip.

He swears it broke Kent for a few long minutes while Bitty stands there waiting for...*something*.

He takes a hint from an old movie and reaches out for Kenny’s tie, uses it to pull his nice boyfriend closer.

The end all be all is that he didn’t get to do much at all! They were both worked up pretty good anyhow, but just a few minutes rocking together, a few sweet words, (and then a few dirty ones maybe), and both of them were seeing stars.

The two of them get a fast shower and re-dressed in under forty minutes. Kenny looks amazing in a blue button-up that makes his eyes more grey, and Bits goes for a v-neck so he doesn’t actually *die* in the heat of a club.

On their way to meet the team, neither of them talks about how he’s only got two days after tonight to be in Las Vegas. They move right around that disheartening fact and focus on the now, thank-you very much.

If he and Kenny move off to a shadowy part of the dance floor and grind against each other like teenagers, well, there’s no one close enough to tell his Mama, so he just enjoys every moment.

\*\*

The FaceTime request is late their time, but it starts when they just happen to be stumbling in Kent’s front door, fighting to get their clothes off without leaving off with the hot and heavy making out.

Kenny slammed his knee into an end table, and Bitty literally fell over Kit, so luck and a little bit of drunk was not on their side.

He finds himself lifted up on his feet, yelping when he’s pretty much thrown over Kenny’s shoulder with his pants around his thighs and his ass in the air.

“My Lord! *Boy,* put me down!”

He gets dropped on the bed, bouncing when there’s a whole lot of hockey player between his legs, kissing the daylights out of him.

## ASC -All Star Classics

The All Stars is for hockey legends and up-and-coming players.

Mr. McLean comes in the locker room with news on who from the Rebs has been chosen.

“This year, the Rebels will be sending two players to the All-Stars. First, Vasily Yurevich Tolstoy–”

Dime stands up and gives a short nod to the applause.

“–and Eric Bittle.”

The rest of the team looks as shocked as he does, and frankly, that’s not very reassuring. But before he can stand on up and start rambling to dispel the *awkward*, the boys jump to their feet and stomp on over to him, throwing a celly right there in the locker room.

Wheelhouse doesn’t care Bitty is still in his pads. “Good fucking news, eh?! Lookit our boy!”

“*Dude,* you better make us look *bomb*.”

“Congrats Itty Bitty! They know we’ve got some fucking *class* here at Reb Arena.”

“Check the fuck out of that douche from the Oilers. I hate that asshole.”

“I demand *pie* before you go, Bits. It’s a whole week long.”

And just all of them talking over each other.

“Oh but!” He looks a little helplessly at his team, “it’s my first year! Is it really all right to go?”

He gets pats on his head and shoulders, advice on which other All Stars will show and who to look out for, so there’s really no question. He’s got to go and make the team proud.

Mr. McLean steps in and congratulates them. He leans down and asks Bitty to come to his office before he leaves today, pats him on the shoulder again. Racoon winks at him and there’s more chirping to go around.

“I think it’s in San Diego with the Gulls this year. Bits, you better go party your nuts off.”

“That would be mildly uncomfortable,” he chirps back, “but if I go, I promise to try and have some fun.”

“Pics or it didn’t happen.” Dusty gives him a gun finger on his way out.

“Mmhm. I’ve learned not to do social media while I’m compromised, thank-you *very* much.”

“Aw, you’ll be fine. Dime will be your roomie, so no one will mess with you,” Booster claps him on the back, “and I’m serious about the pie. Don’t leave us hanging, Itty Bitty.”

He scoffs, clearly offended.

He waits out most everybody and then slinks his way to Mr. McLean’s office, fingers knotting up, biting on his lip. His stomach turning, he knocks gently on the door.

Racoon is there, already out of pads while they’re looking at a computer screen with plays and such, Coach is beside him pointing at things with a ball point pen. All of them come to attention when he hovers in the doorway.

“Hey, come in and close the door, kid,” Racoon waves him on and they don’t look like he’s in trouble. That’s a relief.

“Bittle,” Mr. McLean gestures to the other chair in front of his desk, and with an “*oh!*” he hustles on over. “Thanks for stopping by.”

“Yes, sir.” He makes his hands stay still in his lap, puts on a polite smile.

Luckily for him, Racoon is the one that starts talking.

“So, kid, look.” He leans down with his forearms on his knees just like he does when they’re in the locker room before or after a game, and something about it eases the tension in Bitty’s spine. “We kind of sprung the All Stars on you back there.”

And now all of them are looking at him, waiting for something.

“Well, it certainly was a surprise. A very nice one, and I’m...floored to be honest. I just, you know, wanted to make sure it was okay if I accepted? With the team, of course.” Here he goes, rambling away when they probably have other things to do.

He doesn’t look at Racoon, doesn’t really have to.

“Bitty, if you want to take a few days to think about it, you don’t have to say yes today. We’ve got a month to get you ready–”

He gasps a little and looks up, “you’re gonna help me get ready? Really?”

“Well sure we are, kid. It’s your first time going, so we’ve got you. Wheelhouse and Dusty are probably going to make you stay over a couple days a week. They’ve been before. Me and Nickle went one year. You know, we got you, kid.”

He can’t help how wide he’s smiling, “I’d appreciate it! Whew, that is such a relief, you don’t even know.”

Mr. McLean looks pretty pleased, laughs at him a little. “I’m glad you’re excited. Believe me, everyone on my end is very happy for you, Eric. Yes, this is a testament to how hard you’ve been working this season, and I’ll be honest with you, it looks good for the Rebels to send two players.”

“Think about it, Bitty,” Racoon soothes over. “You let us know by Wednesday, okay?”

He knots his fingers together again and agrees to think about it before ducking out of Mr. McLean’s office.

\*\*

He takes the letter home and takes a picture of it sitting on his bureau, all official, and sends it to Mama and Coach.

She calls up in a tizzy, demands to know what that means, Dickie.

“They picked me to go to the All Star Game, Mama! In my first *year*.”

“Oh! Oh *my*! Hold on, hold on, let me get your father.”

And he gets the muffled *wah wah wah* of her telling Daddy the news and his very obviously surprised and pleased, “say what now?! Give it here, Suzanne.”

He’s on the phone in a New York minute while Bitty is smiling like butter won’t melt in his mouth. His sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, and there’s flour a bit over there. He’s testing out a few recipes for his vlog spin-off series: One-hour meals. The recipes are all tasty and easy-to-make, meant for athletes on the go. Most of them can be made in larger portions to freeze!

(*Kenny and Jack have been helping by testing out the recipes he sends and gives him their opinions. Well, and then Tater might have heard he’s doing research, and then Marty said Gina would try a few, and before he knew it, there’s an email list going around the Falcs.*)

“*Junior*. What’s this your Mama says about All Stars?”

But Coach is sly, and Bitty thinks he’s probably grinning on the other side of the country. “Well, you heard just right. They sent a real nice letter and everything, didn’t Mama show you the picture?”

And then they’re gabbin’ on about when and where and how his stats look, but he just puts Coach on speaker and lets him talk on about it while the rice steams.

By the time dinner is done, he’s sitting at his table on FaceTime, watching Daddy in his recliner and Mama knitting on the couch. She’s looking at his plate and the portion, giving an approving nod, talks about his latest video series while Coach talks hockey and football waving his fork while the other hand holds a piece of pie.

Somehow, it’s like he’s right there in Madison, sitting on the love seat with his phone or laptop, talking between research and social media lurking, and it gives him just a little bit of heartache. The next break, he can’t be swayed by Jack and Kenny. He’s *got* to go home.

He makes it a promise when Mama gets watery when it’s time to go, and Coach just smiles at him, eyes crinkled in the corners.

“I’m real happy to hear they recognize you, Junior. You’ve pushed hard, and you’ve earned it.”

“*Daddy*,” he finally pleads, laying on his arms, “you didn’t say if I should go or not. *That’s* why I called in the first place!”

And Coach guffaws at him, “now you know I’m not gonna tell you what to do. You’re all grown and in a good career, and life seems to suit you just fine. If this is something you want to reach for, then I know you’re going to dig in and do your best. I’m proud of you, Dickie, no matter what.”

He smiles a little, looks out the window at the trees giving him privacy and occasional yard work. “Thank-you, Daddy. I might try giving them a run for their money.”

“That’s my boy.”

And Mama promises to send his latest video to Aunt Judy, but she is just so awful with technology, honey, you know.

(*She is one to talk for heaven’s sake*.)

He tells her he loves her and misses them, that he’s going to visit soon.

\*\*

When he Skypes Jack and Kenny that night, he thinks he might ask them if he should do this or not.

But, his boys take the words right out of his mouth when Kenny comes on the call with a wide grin, “guess who got asked to be special guests at the All Star Classics this year?”

Bitty almost drops his slice of pie, but manages to hold on.

“You, too?” Jack laughs a little, “they asked me and Tater.”

“Then you’re going to have to put up with me and Swoops, Zimms!” Kent crows, sending Kit skittering away.

“We’re going to get to meet up!”

Bitty bites his lip, carries his plate to the sink when he finishes so he can smile away with his back to them.

He’d been so excited to tell them the news, get their opinions, but now, he’s got another plan altogether.

“Hey, B. We can get you a ticket to the game so you can come watch!”

“I’ll check my schedule, sugar pie. How exciting for you two and your boys!”

Jack laughs and talks about Tater jumping around the locker room. Kenny grins and goes on about Swoops, and Bitty just smiles and listens.

\*\*

He and Dime get to San Diego without any problems. Part of that is because Bitty has the Russian to English site on his phone and hits the microphone whenever Dime says something. It’s really working for them, and Bitty’s has caught on to more Russian than he has any business learning.

They get to their hotel and drop off luggage, go around and meet other players from the AHL. It’s strange that he’s Nickel in this situation.

“He says he hopes we’re gonna have a good game.”

“Oh, well he says it’s nice to meet y’all!”

“He says you gotta use that kind of tape if you really want–”

And Dime just pats him on the head and nods when he does.

\*\*

The team he and Dime are going to be playing for is missing players, and that makes Bitty’s heart almost leap out of his chest.

But he and Dime take to the ice when their assigned team is called out to run drills.

Their temporary coach calls them in to make the announcement.

“All right everyone, I’d like to introduce from the Providence Falconers–”

And right there’s Jack and Tater, ready to step on the ice, giving a wave, and right beside them, *Lord*, how did he even get this lucky?

“And from the Las Vegas Aces–”

Swoops sees him before Kenny and nudges his captain, jerks his chin at Bitty standing there with Dime.

Tater sees Dime before seeing him, and gives a wave. Dime nods back and throws a hand to Bitty’s shoulder.

“Will be good game,” Dime tells him with a wink.

The look on Jack and Kenny’s faces when they see him pretty much guarantees that, but Bitty, well he smirks right on anyway.

\*\*

He and Dime start out on the second line, running them together to see how they fit. When Bitty puts on the speed, he leaves them mostly in the dust. Dime is the only one that stays with him, used to trying to keep up.

It’s just like playing with the Rebs when he’s ducking and dodging, making assists, light checking just to get the puck for himself, and he gets two on past the goalie right there in practice.

He doesn’t think about Kenny and Jack watching, just thinks about Dime at his back, just about the center and other wing with him, just about the other team coming at him.

Coach calls out to him and Dime, has them stay out when Jack, Tater, Kenny, and Swoops jump out with them. Swoops takes up the goalie’s spot, and Tater almost tackles him.

“Zimboni didn’t say you would be here Itty Bitty!”

“Well, I tried to make it a surprise,” he drawls out, puffing breath, grinning up at Jack and glancing slyly over at Kenny.

“And you brought this guy!” Tater erupts in some heavy Russian, gloves all over Dime’s shoulders.

“Had to bring my bestie, Tater. How am I gonna score without someone keeping people off me?” Dime probably gets as much as possible and there’s a glove on his head.

Tater laughs down at him and agrees in Russian with whatever Dime says.

Then he gets a look at Jack and Kenny, who still look somewhat shocked yet pleased so Bitty’s gonna take that. Coach calls for them to run plays and see how they do together, which really is something no one is prepared to deal with.

Because once he lines up with Kenny at center and Jack as right wing, everything takes off just that fast.

He and Kenny are quick, but he’s just a hair or so faster, racing against the opposition, weaving around them, showing off his footwork a little since he’s got some people to impress, to prove he’s there for a reason, and they’re not going to regret choosing him.

At the end of their first practice, the line-up will be posted, so he’ll see how it goes.

Jack, Tater, Kenny, and Swoops were pulled away after their first practice before Bitty could even say much more than a word.

He only got a few seconds on the ice of Jack grinning at him from behind his face guard, “good surprise, Bits.”

And Kenny smacking him with a glove, “you didn’t tell us, you dick.”

He shrugs at his boys, Dime right on behind him.

“Well, I did want it to be a surprise in case something like this happened,” he cocks a look up at Dime, who grins back down at him.

They get a whistle to start the next play, and Bitty laughs “Hope you old timers can keep up!” and he’s off.

\*\*

He doesn’t look to his right when he passes the puck far across the ice. Jack doesn’t have to look when the puck is right in front of him and puts on a burst of speed, slamming it up to Kenny for the shot.

None of them notice how easy it is.

\*\*

He catches a breath, looks up at Dime standing there looking back at him with a calm expression. The line-up is right there, and it’s in black and white, *Lord*.

“*Dime*.”

He must sound as worried as he thinks he does because Dime just pats him on the top of the head again with a big hand and reaches past him to point a finger at his own name on the front line with him.

“I know, you’ll be there, too,” and Bitty sighs, “you always take care of me.” But he can’t help but feel a little overwhelmed.

He follows Dime to the locker room they’re using for this week’s practice, face guard pulled up, and gloves off.

In the locker room, he gets to talk up more guys from other teams, and most of them are real nice even if he’s just met them on the ice.

They run out to get something to eat, and Bitty sits with Dime on the bed of the truck he rented for the week they’re in San Diego.

His phone between them, they eat awful drive through food because they are literally starving to death.

Dime stays at their hotel, talking up other players when he can, and Bitty throws his bag in the truck, hoping to get a little bit more ice time, no matter how tired his legs are. By the time he’s done, maybe Jack and Kenny will be, too.

The people running the arena are wonderful and he can absolutely use the ice while no one’s there.

He doesn’t bother with pads, just the borrowed All Stars jersey that has his name on the back and #15, which is about perfect.

He’s not killing himself this time, just taking laps working a puck, ducking and dodging, the slice of his skates loud in the quiet. It makes the nerves ease a little at being here at all.

While he’s taking time for himself, he thinks up a great plan and stops long enough to dial the hotel from his cell phone–

–and rent another room under his own name.

He doesn’t realize how late it is or how long he’s been pushing until one of the ladies asks him how much longer he’s going to be.

He profusely apologizes, hurrying off the ice, not even realizing he’s been out long enough to make himself cold.

He changes into shoes right there on the bench, stretching his burning calf muscles.

He stops off at the front desk to get an extra key for the room he called to reserve, hockey bag on his shoulder. The nice receptionist doesn’t look twice when he gives his debit card.

Hockey players are lounging around outside and in the parking lot. Some of them recognize him from the Rebs and playing before, give him a handshake and a good luck.

He sees Tater hanging out with Dime on the way to his room, both of them with beers in hand, laughing and talking too fast for him to even hope to piece it together.

“ITTY BITTY!” Tater roars the second he comes out of the elevator, and he’s caught up, bag and all held high against the D-Man’s chest.

He’s got to give Tater credit though, he hasn’t even spilled a drop of beer.

“Marty and Thirdy, rest of Falcs, very proud!”

He scuffs the toe of his shoe and grins a little, “I was surprised when they asked me with Dime ‘cause this is my first year and all–”

“But, you only Rookie on Rebels, Itty Bitty! Is very good for you! You worked hard this year, earned it working with this guy!” He nudges Dime and the two share a phrase along with a good laugh.

He goes all red and mumbly, “thanks, Tater. I just...I just wanna make the Rebs proud.”

Dime pats him, says something fast and soft.

“He says,” and wow it’s weird for someone else to do it, “you already make Rebels proud, Bitty. And look! Faster than Parse? Impressive.”

“I-I don’t know about all that,” he laughs it off, tries not to think about how Kenny might be just a little...perturbed at him. You know, for not telling them he was coming to the All Star game too. “But, have you seen Jack or-or Parse?” His hands automatically go to the fraying edge of his hockey bag.

“Went to get food or something, I think. They promise to bring me whole menu back! I am starving. Good practice, good appetite.”

Well, all right then.

He gives them a wave and goes inside now that the sun has set, and makes his weary legs take the steps up to their floor. He wants a hot shower, but there’s some planning to be done if Jack and Kenny might be happy he’s here after all.

So he dumps his hockey bag by the bed with his suitcase, pulls some things out to stick in the backpack he’d brought for just-in-case, and goes down the stairwell to the bottom floor 1590.

It’s empty and perfect. He turns on the AC and lights, grabs bottles of water from the vending machine for the dorm fridge. Checks the bed automatically, and pulls off the duvet.

He hides a bottle of lube in the drawer by the bed and finally gets to jump in the shower, lets the hot water wash over him. He’s going to keep his shampoo and body wash here, those tiny bottles just aren’t enough for a big toe after all.

Nothing from Kenny or Jack by the time he gets out, and he refuses to be upset about it. He runs back upstairs to see Tater on his bed eating a sandwich almost as long as Bitty’s arm, watching TV with Dime and laughing his ass off.

“Oh! You just missed Jack, Itty Bitty!”

Damn it.

“Well, that’s all right,” he admits lamely, “I’m just gonna go out for a while anyway, look around some. So, if you see him again, tell him to text me, okay?”

Tater waves him off with his mouth full, and it really is a sight to watch Tater *eat*. Mesmerising even.

“V and I also want talk to you,” Tater catches him before his hand is on the door handle. “If you want, maybe we trade for the week? You and Jack share room, catch up?”

His back straightens and Tater is grinning, one brow wiggling. Dime looks at him with a smirk. One massive hand makes a *gimmie* gesture, so Bitty hands over his phone with the app already on screen.

Dime says something into the microphone and hands it back.

*I won’t wait up.*

Bitty goes red in the face and ducks out the door while he’s chattering on about nothing.

\*\*

There’s a club not far from the hotel some of the hockey players were talking about outside, and he can literally hear the music from the parking lot.

He only has to walk a block or so to find it, sees the line outside and kind of slides in the back with his ID in his hand.

He is *completely* unprepared for the bouncers to rush up to him, phones in hand, already knowing just who he is.

And what would the people in Madison think about *that*?

“You *wrecked* in that Checkers game.”

“Your stats are insane, kid.”

“Oh, why thank-you so much!”

He’s shocked when they ask him to sign the schedules they’ve got in their pockets, and thanks them for their hospitality when one moves the rope to let him in ahead of everybody. He feels bad only for about a second because this place is *amazing*.

He orders just one drink and moves around the crowd, takes a selfie with the straw between his teeth, smiling away, and puts it up on Twitter with something like *working hard deserves playing hard*.

He gets to talk to some nice people that also recognize him, stands around their table talking hockey, tells them about his vlog, and how he likes to cook. He moves on to another group that points at him and stares, two of the girls hollering out.

“Filo for LIFE!” And Lord aren’t they sweet.

And because he has hips that just can’t help but move, he finds himself on the dance floor, shaking what the good Lord gave him.

He gets a partner somewhere along the line, someone who’s in front of him, yelling about how this is a great song. By the next one, the guys gets a little handsy, so Bitty steps back some but the guys follows him, sliding his hands around to–

But then there’s a big ole’ hockey player right there taking the hand off him before it gets to his butt, and the guy’s eyes go *huge*.

“Hey asshole, look but don’t touch,” Swoops leans over Bitty’s shoulder so the guy gets the message and backs away with his hands in the air.

“Thank-you,” Bitty yells, “that was gettin’ uncomfortable.”

“Yeah? Guy was trying to paw you to distract you, probably to put something in your drink.”

Swoops takes the cup from him anyway, hand on his elbow to lead him off the dance floor. They get their way to the bar and Bitty orders just one more while Swoops gets a whiskey and coke.

“Hey, look up,” and Swoops is holding his phone up to get both of them in the frame, taking a picture while Bitty’s trying to half-smile.

“Uh-oh! Tweeting? Why Jeff, I’m so proud of you!”

The Ace guffaws at him, “I’m texting it to Parse. He and Zimmermann have been looking for you for over an hour.”

Bitty whips his own phone out of his back pocket, and there’s nothing? No texts, no private messages, nothing.

“I don’t know how you know that, but no one’s sent me a dang thing,” he shows his notification free screen.

“Would help if you take it off Airplane Mode, Bits.” Jeff just shakes his head at the kid, points to the little airplane icon at the top of his screen.

“Oh no!”

“Yup,” Jeff puts his phone away and slides Bitty’s back into his pocket, “but, we’re here to have fun before they kill us in pracy tomorrow, so go out and dance. I’ll wait until you’re ready to go in case some other creep comes up on you.”

“Now Jeff, I’m a grown man–”

“Mmhm. Every *grown man* can use someone that’s got his back, kid. Just take this as my billeting instincts.”

He huffs and sips on his fruity drink and saunters his ass right back on the dance floor.

\*\*

He’s got another creeper before the next song gets half-way through.

There’s an arm sliding around his hips, and Bitty jerks at first until he looks up and catches Kenny suddenly in front of him, grey eyes all light with mirth, but his smile is something absolutely...predatory.

“Been ducking us, eh?” Who he now knows as Jack behind him, leaning down to talk to in his ear.

“Never!” He turns so they’re almost nose-to-nose. “Now, you know better than that!”

“Dunno,” and Kent is right there taking a step in, “didn’t even tell us you were going to be here, B. Look at you, invited to the All Stars Rookie year.”

“I was real surprised, to be honest. I mean, I almost turned it down, but Racoon kind of talked me into it,” and then he looks at his drink because he did *not* mean to say that out loud, goodness.

Kent blinks at him, and Jack’s arms go a little slack.

“C’mon, let’s get a drink,” isn’t really a suggestion because he’s caught between Kenny and Jack when they make their way back up to the bar, waving at Swoops on the way.

Swoops who has amassed several people at his table and looks like he’s having the time of his life. Well, good! Swoops is such a wonderful fella.

This round, Bitty asks for a bottle of water, throws down money before Kent or Jack can, makes a shooing motion at the change.

The water is just what he needed because it is *hot* in this place.

Luckily, Jack gets them a table, the two of them with hands on him like they think he’s just going to up and disappear somewhere.

They scrunch their chairs together, shoulder-to-shoulder, closer to the wall to make it harder to recognize them. Kenny and Jack have experience being recognized out in public, so Bitty trusts them to know the tricks.

Once they have at least *some* privacy, Kenny’s infectious grin is back, “I can’t *believe* you’re here and you didn’t even tell us! We told *you *we got asked to guest star!”

Bitty shrugs a shoulder, “I just...wanted to surprise you, I guess.”

Jack’s hand slides over his knee and up his thigh under the table, “good surprise, Bits. We’re happy you’re here. Congratulations, bud.”

Lord, now his face is getting hot again, “thanks, Jack. It was really a surprise. Racoon told me to think about it for a few days before I said no, but I talked to you two that night, and I-I kinda wanted to be here with you, too. I sure didn’t even think we’d be playin’ on the same All Star team though! That’s amazing.”

Jack blinks at him and the big hand on his thigh tightens down, drawing Bitty to tilt his chin up and look at those big eyes. Jack’s mouth quirks, he leans in a little, and opens his mouth, but Kenny is just a little quicker and slaps a hand over it before a single word gets on out.

“The middle of a club with drinks in him is not the way, Zimms,” Kenny warns. “It might end the night in the bathroom if you know what I mean.”

The implications honestly fly right over Bitty’s head because he’s between his boys, “I’ve just had half a one before this, sugar pie.” He shakes his half-gone drink. “So, I haven’t really had a full one yet!”

Jack looks at Kenny, and Kenny just sighs and removes his hand.

“Bits, you were *incredible* today,” and just like he gets sometimes when he’s talking hockey, Jack’s voice gets low, but he’s leaning in too, and *goodness*, he smells wonderful. “Getting on the ice with you...”

“You don’t say, Mr. Zimmermann?” And he covers up a pleased grin by sipping on his drink. But that big hand moves higher up his thigh, and his whole body starts feeling warm because he knows Jack better now since they’ve been intimate, gets the comment from a minute ago.

Wait, they might take him in the bathroom to–

Oh. Oh *my*. But he got a hotel room and everything! He has a *plan*. And it includes him leaving the All Star Classics no longer a technical virgin. *\#goals*

Without realizing it, his hand tightens down on Kenny’s when he feels Jack’s hand through his jeans. He’s biting on his bottom lip to keep a noise in.

Kenny grins a little at him. “That’s enough! Look at what you’re doing to him. Don’t worry, we’ll be back,” and he’s got Bitty by the wrist, tugging him along to the dance floor.

“Be careful, Kenny,” Jack calls over the crowd, but his expression is something closer to anticipation.

Being careful means dancing with just Kenny, and anyone else approaching them is rebuffed, which makes things low in Bitty’s abdomen twist.

He knows something’s brewing because of how tight Kenny’s hands are at his hips, how close they are, how a mouth just barely skims over his throat.

“You have to stop,” he finally pleads, face pink, “or I’m gonna embarrass myself.” His jeans are too tight now, and his button up only does so much to cover the problem.

Kenny laughs low in his ear, making his shudder, and goose pimples spring up on his arms.

“We don’t want that, do we, babe?”

“Sugar pie,” and Kenny moans against his ear. “I might have rented an extra room for the week, just in case we’d have time. Y’know me, you, and Jack–”

“Oh yeah? Hoping to seduce us to your room?”

“Maybe, I just want a quiet place to binge Netflix,” he chirps back, “but if you boys are nice, I might give you the extra card.”

“Mm, I’ll have to think of something to make that worth your while.”

“Well, I think telling me we don’t have to wait until the offseason would be a good start.”

Kenny stops dancing behind him, hands getting tight enough to bruise. “You serious, Bits? Like, you-you’re ready? Don’t chirp me with that–”

He glances over his shoulder, gives Kenny a sly grin, “honey, I didn’t bring that much lube just to chirp you about it.”

Those gray eyes go cloudy for a moment, “all right. We’re out of here,” and he’s laughing when Kenny just pulls him on off the dance floor and right up to Jack’s table, sucking down the last of his drink. He leans down and talks in Jack’s ear without letting go of Bitty.

Jack’s eyes go wide and he looks up at Bitty with a raised brow. It only takes a second before Jack is out of his chair in a New York minute, leading both of them out the door.

\*\*

Now that his phone isn’t on Airplane mode, he gets notifications of missed calls and texts, and goodness, Shitty sent him a selfie of him, Lardo, Ransom, and Holster all sporting Bitty #25 Rebels jerseys, and it almost makes him tear right up.

He keeps on trotting along behind Jack and Kenny, checking his messages with his free hand while Jack keeps hold of his wrist with the other. They’re talking and chirping in front of him, so he lets them just lead him on back to the hotel.

When Jack drops his hand, he realizes they’re probably close to the parking lot. He gives them a few steps ahead so it doesn’t look bad for them, hovers back a little so the hockey players hanging out in the parking lot won’t see what’s going on.

Kenny gives him a funny look, but keeps pace with Jack.

It’s not a shock when someone calls out to Kenny and Jack follows on beside him, giving Bitty time to duck into the hotel. They both catch sight of him going, but are trapped in a conversation.

Which means he has some time.

He swipes his card in the slot, and Dime is already snoring away. Tater looks glassy eyed himself and flaps a hand.

“Already move bags, food in little refrigerator,” the massive Russian yawns, holds out a door key, “here, we swap.”

“All right,” Bitty made sure he’d know the difference between keys by putting the one he’d gotten privately in the back of his wallet. “Thanks Tater.”

“Mmhm, go have fun with your boys,” and Tater slouches down in the bed, a big ole’ sigh as Bitty’s leaving the room.

He lets the door click shut quietly, the new key to Jack’s room in hand. But, dang it, Tater didn’t tell him the room number.

Bitty takes a breath because *it’s fine* and takes off down the hallway toward the stairs at the end. He might hear something, turns to see Kenny all the way at the front.

And *oh*. *Oh goodness*.

He laughs out loud and takes off again, running all out the rest of the way down the long corridor full of rooms. He only glances back to see Kenny giving chase, and *oh boy*, there’s Jack too.

This–this is

And if anyone had asked him months ago if he ever thought being chased through a hotel by two big hockey players would be a thing for him–

–well, he’d have probably still said yes, but he wouldn’t have even imagined it would be Jack and Kent coming after him like this.

“B!”

He’s huffing and puffing, hitting the bottom of the staircase, looking up at Jack and Kenny above him.

“Well, gonna have to catch me now, aren’t you?” And he laughs again at the *look* on their *faces*.

Going this way, the room he rented is down two more corridors (*he thinks?*), and he’s just beating feet around corners and down long stretches, laughing like he’s lost his ever-loving mind.

He’s pretty sure they’re still behind him somewhere and whoops as he gets down the next corridor close to his lone room, legs pumping to eat up the ground under him, almost home free–

–when the wall of hockey player steps out from the hallway half-way between him and the end.

Bitty ends up right on his ass, panting like crazy up at Jack’s smug grin. A glance behind him and Kenny’s right there, blocking him off, grinning like a mad man with his hair all wild.

“Seems like we caught you,” Jack’s voice is low and deep and that look in his eye is very, very… predatory.

“Well,” he draws out, taking in the details, “it might seem that way.”

Until it isn’t.

Bitty is good on the ice because he is *fast*, but his footwork is just as good. Jack, however, has excellent reflexes and only misses him by a *hair*.

He almost loses it, but keeps on his feet. If he didn’t have the room card already in hand, he’d wouldn’t have even made it. As is, he only gets about a step inside the room before Kenny’s on him, lunging to take them both down to the dang floor.

(*How in the world did he get past Jack?!*)

They’re both laughing and gasping like fools when Jack pretty much picks them both up under his arms and throws them on the bed as the door clicks closed behind him.

\*\*

Somewhere along the line, Jack is between his legs, sucking at his neck and sliding both hands under his shirt while he’s laying back on Kenny, being kissed within an inch of his dear *life*. And if this is their way of paying him back for running them all over hell and creation, then he’s going to get wings for his feet and let them chase the *hell* out of him.

It might kill him with how Kenny’s moaning in his mouth, palm sliding down to cup him through his pants, and Jack’s teeth in his shoulder where he’s pulling the v-neck in a tight fist like he might just-might just rip this flimsy thing right on off of him–

(*That is too hot for more words, the thought making him shudder between them*)

–but it would be worth *this*.

“Boys, please,” he pants when Kenny finally pulls off him, but Jack leans up to dive in, suck on his lip before shoving his tongue inside.

And Kenny’s hand flips the button on his jeans, Jack helps him lower the zipper, and hands are sliding in, playing along his hip bones and the tops of his thighs. Kenny moves a hand to wrap an arm around him and lift him on up enough for Jack to run both hands around to grips his ass and his hands are so big and warm and *finally, ****finally***.

The chirping and teasing and watching them do it to each other and how it takes both Kenny and Jack *apart* to make love like that, and he’s slowly dying of *want*. Over and over it’s just been mouths and fingers and toys and he is just *done with it all*.

So he helps by lifting his hips, letting Jack pull away to peel his jeans down his legs, flipping off shoes and socks, just leaving him in his shirt and–

(*Mmhm. This is why they are so lucky because Eric R. Bittle can be one *devious* son of a gun.*)

He bites his lip at the look on Jack’s *face*.

Because Falc blue looks very good on him, thank-you very much. Especially when his dick is making them strain.

Kenny laughs against his shoulder, “oh, you’re going to kill him, aren’t you, babe?”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about, sugar pie.”

Jack’s eyes flutter and he sucks in a breath through his nose. “I hate to break it to you, but...Kenny and I kind of–”

“Oh *no you didn’t*,” he absolutely sits right on up to scoot around so he can see them both. “You two are not having another–” his hands flutter around “–sex competition, right?!”

Now they both look guilty as sin. *Dammit, just why? Why is it so hard to get properly laid when he has *two*, count ‘em, *two* boyfriends.*

Because of bad decisions like this:

“That is not to say we aren’t absolutely going to get ourselves off in the most pleasurable way possible–” Kenny starts, one calming hand out, “*but*, we want time to enjoy it, Bits. You only lose your virginity once! And with the All Star game, we’re going to be distracted.”

“Hockey is hockey,” Jack shrugs, “and your first time might leave you too sore to play your best game. But, we think after the game--”

“--would be the perfect time to make sure you are fully and happily debauched.” And now they’re inching closer on their knees, looking all cute and playful so he won’t be hopping mad.

(*Because he planned it all, dang it. He had everything ready!*)

He drops his face in his hand and sits back on his knees. He’s red down to his chest, taking a shaky breath because he is *so* turned on right now and this is not at *all* what he’d been hoping for.

He’s all hepped up, prepped himself a little when he’d showered, danced all up on Kenny, ran them around the building, all of it to *not* get gloriously fucked.

Soft kisses to the back of his neck, hand on his side to steady him.

“How is this my life right now?” He grouses while the kisses still feel nice.

Another hand sliding over his shirt up his chest.

“Professional athlete, Bits,” Jack starts kissing on the other side.

“I feel better knowing I’m getting cockblocked by hockey,” and it’s so dry he hopes they both feel just *awful*.

He gasps when Jack’s big palm slides right over the curve of him where he apparently hasn’t lost interest, and his hips jutter forward into the touch.

“Doesn’t feel like anything’s blocking it,” and there’s a little bit of teeth, thumb moving circles to make Bitty’s brain short circuit. The chirping just makes him less mad.

Kenny slipping behind him to press his cock trapped behind his zipper right against Bitty’s ass is starting to make it a little bit better.

Jack takes up the front of him, leans over his shoulder to kiss Kenny while still rubbing on him like that, taking up all his ability to think of anything but moving his hips in circles, laying his head back on Kenny’s shoulder so he can watch them.

Oh.

Oh Lord.

“You’re going to make it up to me, both of you,” he grins at the beautiful idea. Little bit naughty, little bit nice.

\*\*

His exact words were, “*you two are gonna make me come hard enough I can’t walk. Then I’m gonna watch you fuck each other until I let you both come. Everyone understand?*”

Which is how he’s barely keeping it together.

His knees and thighs are shaking, and Kenny’s shirt is shoved in his mouth because even if they are in a hotel, they’re in a hotel full of hockey players, and, well, Bitty. He’s loud.

He’s almost bent over Jack’s shoulder, eyes teary and moaning pitifully when Jack opens his throat and takes him in deeper. Kenny follows it up by slapping his ass but diving right back in to lick into him.

He’s got hands on both of them, one behind him on Kenny and the other on Jack’s shoulder, trying to keep his knees from giving out on him.

He might start begging when Kenny finally gives him fingers alongside his tongue, and he’s going to *die*.

Jack is shirtless, just in unbuttoned jeans, and Bitty can see the back of those cute boxer briefs. He tries to remember one of his stipulations is that he helps strip them down.

Jack swallows around him, and Kenny literally moans in his ass then everything is gone except how good it all feels, so much with both them working him like this.

He tries to say their names, tries to stay on his feet, tries to hold on when the pressure is building, and it’s too, too much.

He sobs out a muffled warning, but Kenny takes the time to twist his fingers and twitch and it’s all gone, every thought but riding the waves until his knees finally do give up the ghost. Jack manages to pull off and ease him down between them, pull the shirt from his mouth so he can catch his breath.

They’re cute as hell when they chirp him softly, how sensitive he is now, how well he responds when they touch him.

It makes his face red as a house on fire, but he brings it back around when he stands up from between them, and offers up some hands up.

It doesn’t take much to wiggle between the two of them to get pants down and unnecessary under things out of the way while Jack and Kenny kiss all soft and cute, building themselves up a little.

“Just like that, sugar pie,” he strokes up the back of Kenny’s thighs, thumbs opening him up, can hear the noise his Ace makes in Jack’s mouth.

Up on the bed, Jack’s laying on his back with Kenny on top, braced on his elbows, and the picture they make is nothing less than *perfect*. Bitty’s on his knees by the bed with one of Jack’s legs hiked up on his shoulder so he can open them both up–

And control who get to fuck who.

*Lord*, what have these boys done to him?

(*“Boss around a bunch of athletes? Little ole’ me?”* If only he would have known this is where life would bring him way back when he’d told that to Foxtrot.)

He goes from kissing the inside of Jack’s knees right by his face to sliding his tongue all slow up the line between Kenny’s thigh and ass. The bottle of lube by his knee flips open, one hand sliding up to slick where Jack and Kenny are frotting together, earning a noise out of them both when his slick hand just smooths between them, jerking them both just a little to tease. His fingers make his way to Jack, to trace around him, slick him up real nice.

He can reach far enough to keep Kenny open and do the same with his mouth.

When they’re done, he’s going to chirp them right into the *ground*. Kenny is moaning and shaking, hips jerking against his face and Jack’s dick, sounding perfectly undone.

Jack is quiet but the knee on his shoulder firms and releases to work his hips down on Bitty’s fingers, two slicking him up right nice. Kenny does something to make a moan come out and Bitty slides in another.

And he is giving himself some good boyfriend points for a private room and having these two beautiful men under his hands and mouth, moving and moaning and panting just for him.

Kenny’s thighs are starting to shake, and Bitty finally moves back, considers what he wants to see first.

“All right boys,” he wipes his mouth with his shirt and lets Jack’s foot back down on the floor, giving him a little pat before he stands up and stretches his sore legs. He figures he wants to be comfortable for the show, and slides on down to the unoccupied side of the bed.

Jack’s eyes are glassy, and his mouth is puffy and pink. Kenny is so beautifully red down his throat to his chest.

“Beautiful,” he sighs to himself with a smirk, “*but*, you two are going to work for it. Kenny, throw his legs up and show me how he likes it.”

And those gray eyes sharpen and his smile is so wonderfully devious. He leans in to give Jack a deep kiss, hips working a little before he leans back up. “You heard him, Zimms. That sound okay to you?”

“I should mention there’s a caveat,” Bitty throws an arm behind his head, works himself real slow while looking at them from under his lashes. “When I say *switch*, Jack is gonna get his turn. You boys understand?”

Now both of them are staring at him, mouths open, eyes wide.

“Really?” And Jack’s eyes twinkle, he and Kenny exchange a very aroused look.

“Really. I say switch, the tables turn, all right?”

“You are devious and I love you,” Kenny deadpans and then lurches forward to give him a thorough kiss.

“Go on, sugar pie.” Bits gives him a kiss on the nose, “I want to see this live and in person.”

He can’t even believe how incredible it is to watch Jack’s back arch, his mouth drop open, eyes closing with the feel of Kenny pushing into him. His hands are fisted in the sheets, and Bitty stretches his free hand out, just brushing their fingers together. Jack’s hand scrabbles for his, holds on for dear life.

(*Next time, he wants a chair so he can see Kenny moving inside him, taking him, and just the sight might make him come as it is*.)

He lets the two of them work themselves up, moving together, breaking each other down, Kenny folding Jack almost in half at some point.

And then he calls it. “Kenny. Stop.”

Shakes them out of their spell, brings them back down just enough for both to look on up at him, panting and trembling, and holding one another so tight.

“Switch.”

Jack gets it first, and absolutely throws them over. Kenny turns over under him, bracing on his elbows, “like this. Zimms, like this.”

Flip of the lube and Kenny’s head drops to dangling between his shoulders. “Seriously?!”

“Fingers first,” but he sounds strained, watching what he’s doing and yes, next time, Bitty’s getting a chair. But then Kenny’s hand comes out, moves over the bed, and finds his fingers, grips at him.

“S’all right, honey. He’s gonna feel so good isn’t he?” And Bitty feels so drawn in by those eyes, and how Kenny looks absolutely wrecked on his knees, fingers working him further open.

“Yes, yes, yes,” and he moans, closes his eyes, arches back into Jack, “so good, B. Fuck, I’m ready, c’mon.”

“All right, bud. Breathe for me,” and Jack folds over him, leans in to kiss his shoulder, bite softly when he pushes in, slides slowly, because Kenny’s still so tight, even after his fingers and Bitty’s mouth.

“Kenny,” Jack pants, forehead against the base of his neck, back teeth grinding. It’s so hard to go slow, to stay still, to let Kenny adjust to him. He feels so good, so amazing, but Jack knows it’s been a while, that he needs to take care.

“Please, Zimms,” Kenny pants out under him, death grip on the sheets and Bitty’s hand.

“Easy,” and he slides a hand around from Kenny’s hip, starts to work him, get him hard again to distract from the stretch.

The low moan lets him know he’s doing everything right, and he kisses the back of Kenny’s neck, mouthing at him.

He’s not prepared for hips to shove back into him, taking him in all the way, and it’s so warm and wet and *tight* that Jack’s brain freezes and he wraps himself more around Kenny, holding on. Both of them are so deep into the moment, Bitty moving doesn’t register immediately until Kenny’s chest contracts, a noise caught in his throat, wet sounds from under them.

He gets tighter around Jack and the groan is followed by short jerks of his hips.

“C’mon, c’mon, move,”

\*\*

“I said I was *sorry*,” he laughs again, finishing off his bottle of water.

“I don’t even know how you left your phone on Airplane mode,” Kenny deadpans at him, head on his thigh.

“I was nervous the whole way here,” Bitty shrugs a shoulder, “I had Dime and I knew y’all would be here, but still.”

“If today was anything to go by, we’re going to be golden,” and Kenny’s eyes roll on up to him, brow raising. “I mean, you pretty much gave Jack a hockey boner the last hour we were on the ice.”

Jack shrugs, laying on the other side with his head lower on Bitty’s thighs. “What do you want me to say, bud? Good hockey is good fucking hockey.”

“It was a good time,” Bitty admitted with a grin, cheeks pink.

“B, you were fucking *incredible*, my God.”

Jack makes a cutting motion, “Today was a whole different Bits.” And Jack wiggles his eyebrows, “I like it.”

“Agreed. Super sexy hockey boyfriends,” Kenny just shrugs, “that’s going to be our ‘ship name.”

SSHB, hm. He could work with that.

“Seconded,” he allows. “That’s adorable, sugar pie.”“Aw, thanks babe. You put the *B* in boyfriend,” and the silly man leans on up and kisses Bitty’s nose.
