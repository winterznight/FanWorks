Me talking to babe about this short thing: yeah, it’s kind of a ride

Chip babe squealing ideas: I mean, who doesn’t love cyclical timelines with smut, kinks, a chase. We love that.

Me: Maybe some dom/sub undertones, competent, Future!Tim with a *plan*. More innocent Past!Timmy with older, wiser Bats that have a pretty solid theory this is the event that gets them all where they need to be. Give me things like Older!Tim talking dirty to Jason about his Robin!Jason fantasies while literally riding his hips.

Chip babe:

When the call comes in from the Cave, Nightwing immediately answers because he *knows* how impatient Little D can be.

No one wants to deal with the fallout if Baby Bat is kept waiting too long.

What he doesn’t expect is for his Baby Bat to sound at his wits’ end.

“You *must* come back immediately, Grayson,” and yeah, he hears the echoes, the chips from the bats flying around the Cave.”We have a…situation.”

He glances over where the Red Hood is tying up baddies they just took down. “We’ve got a sitch at HQ,” and the helmet swings his way.

“Yeah? S’mthing Demon n’ Daddy Bat can’t handle?”

“Apparently,” N shrugs and taps his comm back on, “all right, once we get these ones wrapped up, we’ll be on our way back.”

“Do not take side trips, Grayson.”

“Yeah, yeah, I got it.” As he ends the call.

“Sounds like a shitshow, Big Wing,” Hood remarks mildly when they finish up. He snags N by the waist, purposely palms an ass cheek before the grapple fires and time to *fly*. The landing is close to a Ducati branded for N. As they ride tandem, they talk about possible traps on their way back since, *you know*, Gotham and the lives they lead.

Hood hops off not far from the Cave’s entrance, pulls the .45s to wait on the signal, and N activates his usual security traps in preparation for crisis mode as he cruises through the hidden entrance. His sixth sense is definitely *tingling*.

Imagine his surprise when Little D leaps from around the med unit in his pajamas and stomps over to where N is powering down the bike.’

“Dami?” is soft, every instinct on edge, hands twitch toward the escrima sticks on his back.

On the verge of sixteen, Dami hit a growth spurt this summer that made the top of his head brush N’s nose. Still, the surprises keep coming when Dami grabs his wrist tightly and leans in close. Eyes constantly moving behind the whiteouts, scanning every inch of the Cave for something, *anything*.

“Grayson,” is low and growly, just like B. Dami’s head tips back to look up at him, “you *will* do something about this immediately. This cannot be allowed to stand.”

Automatically, he pulls his little brother in, “okay, okay. I’m here, what’s going on?”

“...where is Todd? Was he not riding in with you?”

“The way you were talking, we thought it could be a trap,” N explains shortly, still on edge. He taps his comm, but Jason is already sliding down a line to the ground, making his way through one of the few secret entrances like he’s still living the pixie boot life.

“S’all right, Demon, we gotcha back, y’ feel me?” He deactivates the helmet for the domino underneath, .45 still in one hand.

When the Brat Wonder gives him a lookit, Hood’s spine straightens because that expression can only be described as *haggard*.

“You will not thank me for calling you,” he murmurs just low enough for the two of them to hear.

“Kiddin’ me, punk? Ya think I don’ like ta tear ass once n’ a while?”

And Dami closes his eyes, gives in to *facepalm* because Todd will regret those words in a completely different context very, very soon.

“We have a time traveling visitor,” he cuts to the chase, “future-Drake is almost finished with the usual tests. He has promised to keep details of the future to himself.”

“It’s *Timmy??*” And yes, Jason’s motherfuckin’ ears strain at Dickie’s dolphin squeal.

Demon suddenly slides back and gives ‘em the type of smirk what means the lil’ asshole’s got somethin’ ta be smarmy about.

“Indeed, Grayson. You should go smother him with your incessant affection immediately.”

“Aw! You really do pay attention to the little things, D,” he ruffles the top of Dami’s head with his usual gusto, and turns on his heels to stride closer to the screened medical bed so he can see older Timmy with his own eyes! Who knew when the last time he had proper cuddles and big brother shenanigans?

The procedure for time-traveling Bats is the standard hanging out sequestered in the Manor or the Cave with horrible daytime television and Alfred snacks. No making trouble because all the Flashpoint fuckery turned the world on its’ *ear*.

Dick immediately sees himself spending the next few days to few weeks keeping this Tim company between his shifts at GCPD and the usual night work.

“I hear we have a *visitor*,” he sing-songs, already tapping the whiteouts up so he can peek around the curtain with fluttering lashes, “oh *Marsha *–”

It was an absolute mistake to *look*.

Future-Tim’s bare back isn’t as broad as Bruce or Jay or even *him*, but the lines from waist to shoulder are made for hands to trace. The Red Robin tights are easily recognizable if not designed slightly thinner, tighter against the curve of ass and meaty thighs. He’s beautifully defined, bulkier with muscle than his present self, just like in his earlier Robin days when they were still thick as thieves. Something in N’s hind brain wonders which of the fine white lines are on his Timmy *now* and how many are waiting in the future.

The shag of too-long hair against his nape, framing those violet eyes when their visitor turns to look over his shoulder from Alfred’s analysis.

“*Holy shit*,” warm breath against his ear because Jason apparently followed on his heels, “Baby Bird’s gonna be a *snacc* some day, you feel me here?”

Dick has to swallow before he can form some kind of rebuttal. “C’mon, Jay.”

“Ya seriously ain’t tellin’ me ya don’t wanna see if’n we can bounce a quarter off that ass? Ain’t born yesterday, Big Wing.”

Dick elbows him hard enough to make Jason grunt.

“Ah! Master Dick, Master Jason, most opportune timing.” Alfred steps from around older Timmy, holding his saucer with one hand, stethoscope still around his neck, sleeves rolled up to under his elbows. “I see Master Damian has advised we have a bit of a mishap with our Master Tim’s patrol tonight.”

Neither Dick nor Jay missed Alfred’s free hand gripping older Tim’s shoulder, squeezing in that way he has to show everything from pride to concern.

“Bad guys are normally dick bags, Alfred. Luckily, I remember this, so it shouldn’t be more than a few days before we switch places again. As long as I stay away from certain things, everything should be fine. Or, as fine as Gotham can be, I guess.”

Hair falling in his eyes, older Timmy smirks at them. His jaw is sharper, his teeth white against slightly pink lips and Dick might be having a slight crisis here.

(He knows Jay isn’t having any better luck just from the very obvious way he crosses his arms and angles his chin down to look at their time traveling visitor.)

But honestly, he wants to know what “certain things” future-Timmy is talking about.

\*\*

*Holy shit Gotham* is more chill than he realistically expected.

Time traveling ten years in the future wasn’t part of his plan, but now that he’s swinging in the shadows, taking in the sights, he isn’t really mad about it.

When he imagined future! Gotham, he always thought things would be pretty much the same. Old signs of destruction caused by any number of the Rogue Gallery, newer high-rises with up-and-coming technology, slightly overgrown parks Ivy kept looking fab, a bat signal just a little more high-tech than the last *three*.

You know, standard things.

What he didn’t expect to see is the population of Gotham moving leisurely along the sidewalks and streets of the East-Side, not scurrying in the usual “*shit might go down any time now*” kind of way.

It looks…peaceful.

(He takes some comfort in the fact the usual citizens still don’t bother to look *up*.)

So he takes a few minutes with some of his favorite gargoyles, nudging his somewhat taller self back against stone wings so the current Bats in this future timeline won’t see him immediately. (*Though, if O’s still kicking it in the Clocktower, he’s probably already been spotted, so he braces himself for the inevitable cold shoulder and being hauled back to the Cave to be quarantined by his lonesome until they figure out a way to unfuck time and shit*.)

He breathes in the night air, cleaner from up this high, tired from a slew of long nights and hard cases, wondering if the *him* of this time went back to the past or if the two of them might meet and maybe destroy the universe because of things like the *doppelganger *theory and time fuckery.

He could run the numbers, probably do some hacking, find out where other vigilantes are tonight.

But as he looks over at the neon sign of the Iceberg Lounge, he thinks he might just take a look around.
