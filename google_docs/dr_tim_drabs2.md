Steph waves wearily on her way to her car, and he turns to start the trudging walk back to his apartment. It’s been fucking *ridiculous* and he’s literally dragging a shoulder against each building he passes just to make sure he isn’t weaving--

One second Dr. Stephanie Brown was walking to well-worn Volkswagen, the next she turned around to shout at Tim again, remind him they’re starting *Jessica Jones* this week when her best friend just

Disappeared.

She blinks, startled at it enough to flinch.

“Tim?”

Her eyes go automatically to the line of tenement buildings around the hospital and she catches just a hint of dark blue in the night, the white bottoms of the Vans disappearing around the tallest. She’s utterly breathless watching one of Gotham’s vigilantes carry her bestie away like a damsel in distress (she is seriously going on Match.com one of these days if *something* doesn’t start happening soon).

She turns back again and starts to her car with a shake of coiled blonde curls bobbing gently to the motion.

When she hits the key fob, her lights flicker briefly, but she’s fuzzy with exhaustion, already yawning with the notion to just *sit* for a while and go home where a bubble bath and delivery pizza and Netflix will be *hers* dammit--

She doesn’t notice the footsteps behind her.

“Oh *baby*. Did it *hurt* when ya fell from heaven?”

\*\*

Batgirl is just *amazing*.

Cradling her bruised, bloody knuckles, she watches the vigilante take out the last terrible, looming, hulking, *asshole* that just *“wanta ****party**** baby*.”

Gross.

What they *got* is an a fucking *beatdown*. Her immediate hard kick to the first thug’s nuts was enough to stun the rest of them for her to get a few good shots in. So close to her car, she could have put them down long enough to get the .9mm Taurus in the glovebox since three against *one* are terrible odds in Gotham City.

When the hand fists in her hair and *pulls*, she has an immediate thrill of fear along with the sharp pain.

That when the shadows come out from the niches of the night, and a booted foot takes the man’s face *right the hell**** out***.

And since she’s, you know, a doctor, in between getting her own shots in and her knee to the second man’s face (*with a pick-up line like that? No wonder you’re desperate*), she sees the automatic way Batgirl is protecting her right side, knows that she’s already been hurt tonight, sees the ripped skin and lacerations bleeding through the suit.

In no time, it’s over, and she’s a panting mess of *kick-ass*, staring wide-eyed at the vigilante. The vigilante with the mouth in her mask sewn shut (talk about symbolism, much?). And Steph’s heart is thundering in the back of her mouth, her palms sweaty after looking at the dangerous person in front of her, the one slowly straightening in a powerful, graceful move.

This crime fighter could snap her neck without breaking a sweat. Could kill her without really *trying*, but Steph’s eyes go automatically to the hand putting pressure over her ribcage, and the slightest haunch brings out everything in Stephanie Brown that screams to *protect*.

In a low voice, being absurdly gentle, she holds out one hand slightly, “thank-you...*thank-you* for saving me. I’m Steph, Steph Brown. I’m a doctor, a friend of Tim Drakes? He, um. He helps sometimes. You guys, when you get hurt.”

A slow, imperceptible shift of shadows is a nod, an acknowledgement.

“And I have supplies at my apartment, okay? You’re hurt, and I’m a doctor. My-my car is right here, you can get in and I’ll take care of you. Please...please let me help you.”

Gingerly, slowly, not taking her eyes away in case the vigilante decided to just *vanish* like they, you know, have a tendency to *do*, she eases the back door open and *waits*.

Her heart beats while she holds her breath and *hopes*, ‘*please don’t go back out there like this. Please. You could pass out from blood loss, you could get trapped, you could--*’

And it’s a slow, timid step taken in her direction, Batgirl easing forward as if she expects a trap or trick, as if she *expects* the person she just saved to attack while she’s weak that makes Steph’s chest clench uncomfortably *tight*.

But she doesn’t move, doesn’t stop the slow smile easing across her face as Batgirl gingerly climbs into the back of her car and lays down across the seat.

\*\*

She helps the vigilante into her two bedroom apartment, talking gently about how she and Tim got through Med School alive, giving all the terrible details so the soft noises, the chuffs that *could be* laughter, puff the mask out over her mouth.

Putting her charge down in a kitchen chair, Steph takes off in a whirl of activity, completely and totally *awake* now that someone is in need.

She keeps talking while gloving up and taking the basic supplies from her cabinets, the small suture pack for *just-in-case*, when she assesses the hard press of bone against skin. She has Batgirl cleaned up and is making grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup while coffee brews and makes her little kitchen smell like home.

They communicate with various bodily signals and soft noises, the vigilante answering her questions with the gloved hands putting slight pressure on her wrist at *yes* and opening the hold, tapping instead at *no.* And Dr. Brown has been an ER attending in a city labeled one of the top five most dangerous cities in America. She’s patched up murderers, thieves, psychos, and sociopaths, she’s held their victims while they go shocky with pain and loss, she’s wept until she’s empty at orphaned children and dead parents, at people her hands, her brain, couldn’t *save*. And none of it has stopped her from running the gauntlet night after night, none of it has made her flinch back, to leave, to find another hospital in a less dangerous part of the city. None of it has made her less determined to make *this time* the one that counted.

It’s settled deep into her *bones*, this desire to protect, to *save*.

She’s smiling faintly while Batgirl eats the soup and sandwich with shaky hands, pulling her mask up just under her nose, gloves and gauntlets pulled off so her knuckles can be gently treated.

The soup is gone and Batgirl is poised by the window, looking back at her with the white eyes, and Steph takes a breath, reaches out to grip an edge of the cape.

“Please...come back. If you ever need me, if you get *hurt*, come find me. Even if you just text me where you are, I’ll come help you. I *promise*, okay?”

The vigilante perks a little at the offer, tilts her head to one side just slightly, like there’s a silent question waiting to spill out, but the gloved hand reaches out, squeezes her wrist again, and then Batgirl is just--

*Gone*.

Stephanie rushes to look out her window, eyes searching the near-dawn while the breeze blows her hair back and makes her nose numb. She bites down on her lip, staring long into the oncoming day before she can leave the window and try to catch some sleep.

\*\*

Layla is her pride and *joy*. It’s the only other thing in life she takes seriously other than being a doctor.

Being a *mom*.

At sixteen, she’d been scared out of her mind at the prospect of having a tiny person to care for, to raise, to be a *role* model for. She’d been utterly *petrified*. If not for her Tim, she would have given the baby up for adoption and maybe finished high school, but without Layla, without Tim, she never would have gone to college and Med School, she never would have fought so *hard* to make something of herself.

Without Tim, she probably wouldn’t have made it through any of it, would probably have lost her little girl to CPS and resorted to drugs and alcohol the way *her* mom did even after promising her huge belly she’d never go that route, that her precious little one would *never* have to live like that. Tim’s the one that kept her fulfilling that promise.

And Layla loved him to the stars to this day.

When Kyle Redman, the former football star of Gotham High School and now History Professor at the community college, pulls up and waves, Steph sighs still when she has to let her little girl go. It’s only been the last few years that Kyle has started coming into their lives again, and he’s gotten just as enamoured of their daughter as she is. He’s always helped in any way he could, even before he graduated college, but he’d carefully let Steph be the main caretaker of their baby.

When he moved into a nicer part of Gotham, close to the best school, he’d made the offer for Layla to stay with him during the school week so Steph could work her horrendous hours without needing a babysitter.

They’ve ironed out all the awkwardness in the last two years, and Layla is so *happy*, so smart, so well-adjusted, that Steph keeps allowing it, no matter how much she misses the old days when it was just *them* (well, them and Tim really).

She holds Layla’s hand while they start down the sidewalk from her apartment.

“Did you remember Pickles the Frog?”

“Yup!”

“Did you remember your tablet?”

“Got it!”

“All of your books for school?”

“Mmhm, even Math,” and the little pouty moue is just *so. Incredibly. Adorable*.

“That’s my girl,” and before she lets her baby girl get into the car that will take her away for the whole week, she kneels down to grab on, to get *one last squeeze*.

“I *love* you, Peanut.”

And even though it might be getting closer to *that time* when Layla would roll her eyes at such things and whine about being *too old, Mom, you’re embarrassing me*. The nine-year-old just grips on tighter and giggles into her neck with overflowing affection.

“I love you too, Mommy.”

Kyle gets out of the car, smiling gently in the cool, crisp Autumn day. At ease with one another’s space, Steph gives him a hug and wide smile, glad to see he’s finally wearing something other than NFL t-shirts and worn jeans.

“Hey,” Kyle gives her one last squeeze and leans back so he can grin down at their daughter and thumb her chin, “did you girls have a good weekend?”

“We sure did, Daddy!” Layla beams at him. “Mommy helped me make *slime* out of Elmer’s glue and food coloring.”

“That is really cool! I hope you brought some?” And just like when they were stupid kids, Kyle has this incredible capability to get just as excited over the little things as Layla.

“You *bet* I did.”

“We made you your own container,” Steph winks at him, laughing at the peaceful pace, the ebbs and flows, that are her life.

There’s just one thing...*one thing* she might be missing.

\*\*

And it falls heavily on top her awning, heavier than a bird, which is why she opens the window curiously, peering out into the night with drawn brows and the smell of popcorn flowing out the window with her.

The soft taps above her head draw her immediate eye because there’s a masked face hanging over the edge along with one hand. The lenses in the mask are raised and the black eyes are deep and fathomless, full of old pain and new determinations.

It makes Steph catch her breath and raise up both arms.

\*\*

It had been a stupidly hopeful gesture, grabbing supplies to sneak out of the hospital, going online to get a things instead when she started getting guilty about it. (Come to think of it, there *were* more stocks of gowns, gloves, suture kits, intubation tubes, gauze and wraps, just *more* since the Wayne Foundation had seen how much Mercy General did for the people of Gotham and gathered other charities to help the hospitals flailing budget with sizeable donations every quarter or so).

However, she is currently glad with her rockin’ forethought.

Batgirl is too apparently.

This time she’d offered her most comfy pj’s (boy-shorts with *Juicy* on the ass and a tank top with *That’s Not What I Said* in a curly font), and Batgirl took her up on it.

The wicked gash in her thigh along with the variable other white bandages bleeding through was probably just to make Steph’s job a little *easier*.

But like she always *had* to, she powers through it, multi-tasking like a boss to heat up tonight’s fried chicken and potatoes, vegetables and fruit for dessert for Layla before she went off with her Dad for the week.

She has the plate right beside the vigilante before she sets down to work. She idly thinks this might have been *planned* for when Batgirl comes out of her bathroom with a small black mask glued somehow around her eyes, shedding the costume and cowl to let herself be treated.

There’s only a brief hesitation to pick-up the fork and start nibbling gingerly while Steph folds herself down on the floor and starts cleaning the bleeder in the vigilante’s thigh.

“I’m glad you came back,” she rambles on, “if you would have let this go or gotten it infected while you were still on patrol, it could have gotten nasty. I mean, just I’m sure some of what you do means you have to go in very unsterile environments, just some parts of Gotham are *nasty*, let’s be real here--”

Her Justice League mug is full of coffee for the vigilante, and is sipped on delicately, precisely. A soft noise made in the positive. She goes back to the fried chicken and takes a bigger bite.

*Score*. Steph’s fried chicken is *the bomb*.

“I *know*. I got the recipe a few years ago and it’s just gotten better over time. Who knew Chicken and a Biscuit crackers could be so *good*?” She rambles on while the stitches are made and the plate starts to get empty (*no broccoli next time, got it*), and the older injuries are treated, wound with fresh dressings.

Steph is still talking while Batgirl washes her plate and pours herself another cup of coffee. A pad of paper comes out at some point and they’re watching the *Justice League* cartoon on Layla’s profile when Steph gets to see the vigilante’s eyes get wide and she chuckles at the antics.

(“Does Batman *really* have a sense of humor?”

*He’s a troll* is the scrawled reply she’d been secretly *hoping for*.)

And before dawn, before the edges peek over the city, Batgirl is suited back up at her window again, gripping her hands in a firm but easy hold.

“I’m so glad you came by,” Steph gushes, smiling wide. “Come back sometime when I’m making lasagna casserole, or if you’re, you know, bleeding out or something. Even if I’m not here, you can come in if you just need to chill.” *I’ll protect you* is left hanging there, an offer for consideration.

The masks shifts into a smile, and it’s soft, *so soft*, Steph could believe she imagined it.

“*Thank-you*.”

Her eyes might be a little wet when Batgirl leaps into the oncoming day, moving more fluidly than when Steph manages to get her in through the window in the first place. And she waits again, until she sees daylight until she closes the window to get ready to run the gauntlet again.

And if a imperceptibly camera hidden in the crumbling brick and mortar of the building across from her’s catches that wistful expression crossing her face before she closes the window, well, only the dangerous, data-collecting crime fighter (the one who knows *all*) silently *watching* would be able to tell.

\*\*

\*\*

\*\*\*

*I have spoken to several of you wonderful peeps (@satire, @graywhims, @azaels, and @all-seer just to name a few) about this...****phenomenon***. Why is it that no one writes Dick Grayson having crazy acrobat sex? Why? *WHY?* This is the best thing I have ever heard and just--it needs it’s *due*. And who better to do it to than Dr. Drake, who is so damn adorable about it all >.< and let’s make it even *better*. Why not have it be the first time with *that* particular thing, so relatively at the start of the relationship?

Scruffing his foot against the stoop is just a sign of nerves.

Because he’s standing outside Dick’s apartment.

*Dick’s apartment*.

Not N’s safehouse.

Dick’s. Fucking. Apartment.

His face is getting warm even though it’s cold as hell in Gotham this time of year. At least his battered hoodie and worn DC’s make it a little more bearable than scrubs, and it really helps that he might be wearing an old Gotham Knights t-shirt since *some* possessive assholes like to see him in *their* things.

(He wore Jay’s jacket once--the last thing he remembers is coming so hard he literally blacked out for ten hours. Best. Cosplay. Ever. Ten out of *ten* would do *again*\--and again and again...)

But this is different. World’s apart from where they were a few months ago, and the vertigo of the changes is a heady thing to take in.

You know, because he’s a total *fanboy in love* and shit. Sigh. At least he has Steph to moan to.

But this... is the first time he’s been to Dick’s apartment (and it’s an invite, a step into his *real life* outside the mask--all of *that* makes the pressure in his stomach wind *tighter* whenever they came through his window or showed up to walk him home in their real skins).

A rushed apology in the break between the usual catastrophes, a moment for him to crack his neck in the corridor of the old Pediatrics wing when the *smell* finally gets to him all at once and his wonderful boyfriends have been *gone* for over a week.

Dick’s soft, clipped voice when he’s working a hard assignment with the Titans because *scary terrorist organizations want to genetically engineer *frogs* to infiltrate public offices. Frogs, Tim. You can’t make this stuff *up.

It has the desired effect and leaves him laughing like he’s slightly insane and in the third pair of scrubs of the shift because things like blood and spit and tears and *he saved me, he’s real* or *oh shit, he beat the crap out of me, he’s real* wept into his chest.

But Dick’s voice got more soothing and fond, more warm the longer he talks about Steph and Ives and his visit to Drake Industries (*ick*) because the same shit every year. Dick’s all sincere about it when he says the first thing he *wants* is cuddles when he gets back.

And they would do that.

At Dick’s apartment.

*Drop the mic*.

Because at the time, he had the next immediate ten steps plotted out. To run a check on all his patients before the next batch came in after the witching hour, so it didn’t really *sink in*. But when it fucking *does*, he caught a breath on, “*oh*. Yeah, that’s--that sounds good.”

“It won’t be much longer, baby. Promise,” and when the serious pet names come out, it’s really Dick instead of Nightwing. “I’m going to give you *all* the cuddles.”

He leans his head back against the cold wall, an arm wrapped around himself, and scruffing his tired feet against the too-shiny floor.

“Looking forward to it. Be careful saving the world.”

It’s not until he hung up, going back to tackle the next one coming through on a gurney, that the realization smacks him.

This is...*keeping him*.

And that aforementioned pressure get that much more *prevalent *when the door opens to Dick grinning wide and white, immediately gripping him in an all-encompassing octopus hold (one that no one, *no one*, is getting away from--and why didn’t Jay at least *warn* him?) to fit them together.

Dick ducks his head to bring their mouths together, catching his little *eep* of surprise, excited and energetic, adjusting an arm down under his ass to lift him completely off his feet (and *this? Will never not be totally *hot--). He manages to wriggle an arm out enough to slide a hand into soft, wavy hair and kiss back while Dick is seemingly trying to overwhelm him with so much *happiness*. He might get a breath while his back is propped up against the doorframe for long moment while Dick eats at his mouth, slow fucking him with his tongue.

“So glad,” between presses of lips and the exchanged heat, “you came over.”

He’s pretty much carried inside by his vigilante boyfriend and the door closes while Dick finally gives him a little bit of a reprieve and hoists him higher, nuzzling into his face affectionately.

He’s completely *fine* with being held like he weighs practically nothing in the middle of Dick’s living room and wraps his legs around Dick’s hips to help hold himself up--not that he really *needs* to.

“I made you coffee,” Dick is still grinning while moving lower to nuzzle into his neck and nudge the hood out of his way, “and I’ve got Netflixs ready, and there’s stuff for sandwiches because you probably need to eat *real food* Timmy, and--”

And it’s so much for him to see *this* side, to get to have it now that Tim can’t help but grin at the genuine *happy* radiating even when he’s finally set down on his feet. The three of them hadn’t been at this long enough for everything to lose the quickening of the heart and churning arousal at barely a *look*. Hell, he’d only told them a few weeks ago he’d always *known* their secret idents and how much that shit didn’t even *matter*.

Since then, the shop talk hadn’t been nearly as muted, on the proverbial *down-low* (because, you know, *civilian* here). Like some agreement had been made between Dick and Jay that they *could* talk about the Joker’s next breakout or the strategies to take down the emerging gang showing up in the warehouse district with drugs and weapons.

(“Someone’s been supplyin’ Mask alla those new AKs, Dickie,” Jason had taken off the helmet and dominio while Tim treated the minor lacerations by rote and Dick paced as he thought--the moment had given Tim a hard *pause* because they didn’t usually do into finite details around him, and this...this means it’s *okay* for them to now.)

It’s a step further into his world, one that scares the holy *bejesus* out of him at the same time it makes him absurdly *pleased*.

And this? Accepting Dick’s invitation to his apartment on a rare night off while Jay is out of town looking into a rash of jewel heists with Red Arrow (*Roy*)? This is just another step even further in, a variable *panic* when he realizes how far he is, how much further he would have to *be* before there’s no way to come *back*.

But looking up into those blue, blue eyes, the wide, white smile, and his heart gives a thump, the calculations falling to the wayside in the presence of such affection and want (and maybe...maybe once he’s *there* he might not want to go back *anyway*. He can keep running the gauntlet at Mercy while making sure his Robins are good enough to keep *moving*. He’s a spectacular multi-tasker, *really*).

Broad hands, *powerful* hands on his face, tilting him up a little more, and *oops*, he might have got lost there for a second, “hey. Are you all sleep-deprived again? I can cuddle you while you take a nap?”

But the smile is still there, soft and *fond*, and Tim just-- he *just*\--

He pulls Dick down enough to reach, to bite over the lower lip a little and soothe it with his tongue, to get a low noise out of Dick, to take that necessary step closer so he’s pressing up against the soft t-shirt and sweatpants and can bunch his hands in the worn fabrics.

“No nap,” he manages between sucking on Dick’s mouth, “don’t think *that* is in the immediate future. But *hey*,” another quick, chaste one, “hi there big guy,” and another, “missed the shit out of you,” another for just *because*, “glad the megalomaniacs of the world tremble at your *ass* in that suit--”

The chuckle is raspy as hands slide the hood back from his hair and pull the zipper down to get him that much closer to *naked.*

Dick pulls back a little and *sees* what shirt he’s wearing, and without looking away, Dick licks his lips in a tantalizingly *hot* motion.

“So,” and his voice is rougher, more growly like N’s voice, “we’re going to skip most of the tour until later.”

Those eyes roll up from the Gotham Knight’s shirt to his face, and he knows he’s probably blushing like crazy because *damn*. Those eyes? *No one has the kind of will power to resist*.

“But, I will give you a first look at the bedroom if you’re *interested*, Doctor Drake.”

“I’m not-surprisingly good with that,” and he’s a little breathless, letting go long enough to drop his hoodie so it’s the *shirt* and his fists go back to tightening in the soft cotton over Dick’s hip and ribs.

He doesn’t make a squeak this time when he swept off his feet, and his mouth is *devoured*. He might whimper, he might even yell a little when Dick’s fingers thread in his hair and direct him to the side so the tendon in his neck can be sucked and bitten.

His thighs twitch at the sensitive spot being abused so thoroughly, at the sharp edge of teeth, and all he can do it bite down on his lip to try not to sound like he’s falling apart *completely*.

He gets brief flashes while Dick just walks him down a long hallway without raising his head from sucking on Tim’s throat. Pictures of good times and good friends, a room with a whiteboard and computer at an old desk, bathroom with the suit hanging up over the shower rod.

The bedroom, however, is extremely comfortable before Dick ever lays him out on the messy sheets and palms his lower abdomen under the shirt. It’s an easy blue (*naturally*) with thick carpeting and a television in the corner, a small stand, overstuffed chair, and lamp niched in another. The center of the room is completely open, he realizes, dazed with Dick’s hands sliding the shirt up and thumbs circling his nipples and saying such nice *things* against his skin. When he manages to open his eyes to look up at the ceiling, welp, he gets an answer to *why the fuck that it*.

Tim gasps in a breath because he sure as *shit* didn’t expect to see the spiderweb of straps against the high ceiling of Dick’s bedroom (though looking back on it later, the real question is why he *didn’t* expect it). A complicated array of straps the width of his wrist is secured by rings embedded in the walls in a complicated array. Straps with glinting silver rings of different sizes dispersed throughout in some kind of pattern he’s going to get later when his brain isn’t turning to mush under that *mouth* and--

“What--what is *that*,” he manages to get his hands on the hem of Dick’s t-shirt and start to pull it up, eyes for this--this--whatever that is?

Dick makes an inquiring noise against his ribs and *sucks*, almost making him forget, but he keeps pulling enough to get Dick to lean up so the shirt can come off and the soft light can bathe his body and scars softly, can highlight the dips and grooves, the muscle born of fighting the *good fight*.

It’s so much and *not enough* that Tim surges to his knees and *grips*, running his mouth and tongue over collarbone and shoulder, throat and lower. He gets a hand on the back of Dick’s neck to tilt his head back in answer and--

“Oh,” is shaky because he’s made it to a vulnerable scar on Dick’s chest and moans while he sucks. “That’s for playtime. When we want a workout while we make love.”

He pulls off and looks up at Dick’s hot gaze, giving the vigilante enough time to get the shirt up and off of him in a swift move.

His brain stutters. “It’s *what now*?” And now his eyes are *huge*, darting back up at the configuration high on the ceiling while his face gets very, *very* pink.

The smile cutting across Dick’s face is utterly *dirty*, just *sinful as hell*.

“Y-You mean you and Jay climb around that and--and have sex?” His heart is beating in the back of his mouth, his half-interested cock now straining against his fly because *just the mental picture* of his boyfriends bare and muscles taunt to climb, balance, wrap and hold while they are literally suspended in mid-air is just--

A noise spills out of him without even being *touched* because *God, that is so unbearably ****hot***.

“Mmhm,” Dick breathes against his throat, and *yes Dick*, he can feel you smiling like an *asshole* (because *excuse him*, it’s not like *most people* had crazy sex straps dangling from *the ceiling* or anything). “I’m an acrobat, Tim, and we swing from buildings most nights. You know that.”

“Yup,” he agrees immediately, unable to look away now, “but this is just-- I mean, the mechanics *alone*...” and now he’s *whimpering* because just the mental picture of what Dick and Jay could *do* and the straining muscles while his boyfriends contort themselves, hold themselves while they take each other, and--

Dick’s hand slides down to cup him through his jeans, press against his throbbing erection, making his hips jerk automatically.

“*Oh*,” Dick says again, purring this time right against his neck while he’s helplessly looking *up*. “Tim-my, does that make you *hot*? Thinking about us making love to each other like that?”

His hands have found purchase on Dick’s biceps at some point and tighten. “I want to watch sometime,” he pants out, suddenly breathless. “I want to watch so *bad*, Dick you have *no idea*.”

The laugh from the vigilante is low and dirty, full of *promise* when Dick leans back up, eyes now calculating, “watch? I think we can do better than *that*.”

Moving so Tim can see every move he makes, Dick leans to the side and opens the top drawer of his nightstand, rifles for less than a second before he pulls out--

A wide leather cuff. One with a silver D-ring attached.

At just the sight, his trapped cock gives a spurt of wetness to soak into his boxers, and his knees tremble just enough for Dick to *know*.

“Oh my God, you--*you*\--”

But, Dick just grins, quick and wide, tapping a finger on his nose before he’s off the bed and moving across the room, his obvious erection bobbing in his sweats while his hips roll with a very pointed *stalk* that means so, so many things.

Behind the door, Tim hadn’t even noticed the compact pulley system with the main straps secured. With a touch of a button, the straps slowly start lowering down from the tight tension keeping it out of the way of daily routines.

He’s panting again, braced over on his hands, watching as the black straps get closer to reachable height, noticing now the web is made up of three layers of straps, a bottom layer, a middle layer, and a top layer with rings attached on the *inside *of the straps, and--

Tim’s eyes go briefly to the cuff Dick left idly on the nightstand (because the cuffs could attach in a few different places *and could secure someone to be hanging helpless against whatever they wanted to ****do***). His stomach simultaneously drops with dread and clenches with anticipatory *heat*.

When Dick steps away from the pulley system, Tim’s eyes go immediately to the motion, of Dick expertly walking, moving, jumping, ducking, dip and spinning, grab and pulling, around and over and through the system of straps, watches him idly run his fingers over them, over the larger rings meant to be hand holds, watches his body *move* with grace and *power* without even making it *look* hard.

He doesn’t swallow his tongue, but it’s a *stretch*.

Dick moves like water, how he moves when he’s giving a *show*, his muscles work in a terribly beautiful sync, and it’s incredibly, *unbearably* hot to feel like he’s being *stalked* by a very, very dangerous man.

When Dick reaches the center, he pulls at a specific strap and a series of six rise to mid-thigh. It’s at the apex, a set of straps that could support a body, the rings on the cuffs attaching at strategic points to make sure his legs would be kept *spread open*, and *God*, he’s *throbbing* right now just thinking about it.

Like he *knows*, Dick is smiling as he winds one arm in a strap over his head and pulls himself up effortlessly, abs bunching when his legs lift perfectly straight to fit himself down in the cradle of straps as a very informative *preview*.

And Tim can’t tear his eyes away while the straps support the perfect curve where thigh meets ass, the lower back and shoulders. He literally stops breathing when Dick shimmies his hips, undulates for him, mock fucking the air right above him and moves both hands to flick at the rings where the cuffs would connect and--

“Both wrists and ankles,” his boyfriend explains while arching his back, “so you don’t fall. There’s other safety measures in case a strap breaks.”

*Of course there are because it’s ****Dick****. Dick who had nightmares about people he cares about falling--*

Which explains why the bottom layer of straps closest to the floor is under the middle layer with a series of straps meant to cradle, you know, *a person*. It’s to use to maneuver...and act like a *net*.

He has to lick his lips, try to get enough air to say *something* instead of being a proverbial puddle of *please fuck me*.

“And just what are you going to do while I’m all damsel-in-distress helpless?” And sure he already *knows*, but he needs to hear Dick *say it*.

Very calmly, methodically, the vigilante lays it *out*, “I’m going to fuck you in every conceivable position I can think of. And, believe me Timmy, I have an extensive *repertoire*, so we might be at this for a *while*.”

And *oh God, this is his ****life**** right now*.

“I’m going to *ruin* you if you let me have you like this.”

With a twist of his hips, an arch of that powerful body, Dick is suspended above the cradle, right in the v-ee of the lower thigh straps, and none of it, *none of it* is helping him do anything but fist his hands in the messy sheets and *want*.

“Oh *fuck*, Dick, the two of you doing this is the hottest thing I could ever think of, are, I mean, are you sure--?”

“You have no idea,” and those *eyes* have him locked in, sucking any doubts he might have had, “how much I want to do this to you. Timmy, *baby*, I’ll make you feel *so* good. So good you’ll be screaming for me.”

He leans back, hands on the bed, unconsciously baring his upper body, offering himself *up*. “Wow, wow that is...holy *shit*, Dick. If you tell me I’m on Candid Camera or this is some Bat *rite of passage* where you leave me suspended for a few hours until I *crack*\--”

It gets him a low chuckle while his muscles trembled minutely and his cock is quickly becoming a point of *pain* here.

“Nothing like that. You safeword out and I’m getting you down immediately.” With another agile move, spreading his legs for momentum, Dick flips around the straps and lands it just outside the complex configuration.

He’s already leaping on the bed to take Tim down to his back and surge up to take his mouth, so much so *fast* that Tim’s hips twitch up hard with Dick between his legs and some kinky fun times just *waiting* to be a perfect distraction for the next few hours.

Barely leaving his mouth, Dick licks over the line of his jaw, and a hand is working the button and fly to get access, “wanna play first, Timmy. Missed you, wanna touch you. If we make it there, we do--”

“We totally *are*,” because *who in their right mind would pass this ****up***. “If you don’t fuck me soon in that thing I might turn into a supervillain and try to take over the world. Don’t try me, I’m very serious.”

It’s with a the sensuous slide between his legs, gripping him, feeling how fucking *wet* he already is so Dick can palm him and *groan* against his neck. Tim catches a *breath* because his brain is misfiring to his synapsis, his body taking over in the decision-making process. He’s at least with it enough to start shoving at Dick’s sweats because he needs *skin*, he needs to touch, and be opened up, and be strapped down, and all of it. He needs *all of it*.

And just be the feel of his boyfriend’s dirty laugh, he’s going to get exactly what he *wants*.

\*\*

He just doesn’t count on Dick being such an *asshole* and make him almost crazy before they ever *get there*.

Excuses like, *“I need to make sure you’re nice and open for me, baby*,” really means *“I’m going to suck you and finger you until you can’t form ****words****, but no, no, you can’t come until I let you*.”

He is literally going to *die*.

The single most arousing thing: Dick licking over his thundering pulse before fitting a cuff on each wrist; then swirling his tongue and *sucking* on the bone before each ankle is cuffed next. Pink from his cheeks down to his chest, his boyfriend takes a necessary moment to lean up and stare at him with that predatory glint, finally, *finally* getting to the main event.

Dick picks him up effortless, sliding their bare bodies together, the friction making his thighs lock down, stutter to get *more*. And just like the badass he is, Dick maneuvers them through the web without pulling away from his mouth or getting tangled up even *once*.

The vigilante throws a leg over the cradle of straps, slowly lowering him down to sit in the cradle; the first strap supports the back of his thighs, the next series of three up his back to his shoulders, and Dick makes minute adjustments to each without letting him go. His hips twitch when Dick eases his weight down fully, allowing him to test the suspension and stares down, *hungry*, at him again, laid out and panting, muscles tight with anticipation, slowly relaxing once he realizes how stabilized he actually is.

The first cuff is attached to an embedded hoop by the D ring, Dick fingers running down his forearm as he tests the give.

The second one makes a noise work up from his chest, making his wet hole *clench*.

And *yes*, Dick is already well fucking aware this is a *thing*. To be perfectly frank, they’re really the ones that made him realize he had a kink for it--in giving up control, to let the decisions be made *for *him sometimes. Not while he’s in the field, not while there’s someone hurt and in *need*\--never while he’s the doctor with people depending on him, when he has to plan out his moves with every contingency his brain could spit out at any random change in vital functions.

When he’s *that guy* with someone on his table, he can’t give *in*.

The first time Jason zip tied him to the headboard and the two of them started to *work*, he came closer and closer to the realization of how much he could *crave* something.

He didn’t even realize *what* it was that made him fuzzy and half-aware until the ensuing talk when his two boyfriends figured it out for him.

(“*Timmy? Hey Sugar, you were so good for us, but s’time ta’ come back.”*

*“He’s really deep isn’t he?” Fingers in his hair and fuzzy warmth.*

*“Blacked out pretty hard, Big Wing. But howz ‘bout we throw downa bet, yeah? I call it, you bring home donuts.”*

*“Done and done,” nails against his scalp and lazy massage of his hips, gentle, easy touches*.

*“He one that’s gotta give *in* sometimes, Baby Boy. Gotta give it up, you feel me? S’why the ties were a nice lil’ *surprise.”)

Sure, he was slightly mortifying, but he picked the color system as his safeword just so he could leave that convo with an array of excuses before his face caught *fire*.

But, *well*. Vigilantes and such.

Dick blocked the bedroom door casually while Jay gripped the back of his neck and said in no uncertain terms how *not* a problem that is for them, something they can *play with* if he wanted. It isn’t something they have to do all the time, but when it’s been a hard row of nights, when *mortality* is just *that* much closer than the peripheral, when any of them get itchy in their own skin, it’s perfect for all three of them. Dick and Jason have the need to protect, to have absolutely *control* instead of contingencies while Tim can be pliant, let the responsibilities *go* to just *be*.

This is their first time without Jay’s smooth baritone, but he’s already such a fucking *mess*, he might literally explode with *both* of them.

“What color, baby?” Dick hums at him, working his hands down Tim’s arms, to his chest, leans down to flick his tongue over one pink nipple, working it *taunt*.

“Green,” wheezed out, “so green. Like Christmas over here. Please, *please*, you loveable, sadistic, pain-in-my-*ass*\--”

“I *have* gags, Tim. I’m not afraid to use them.”

*Oh...****God***. *How is he not coming right now?!*

He jerks to slide his cock against Dick’s, bucks up helplessly.

“*Really*? Tim, baby, we really need to *explore* so much more, but another time, okay? I want to be able to hear you when I can’t see your face.” And yes, he whimpers when Dick leans up and *away*, leaving him to rut up in the air with trembling thighs and pre-come painting his stomach.

One leg is raised up and the D-ring attached, his calf petted affectionately.

“The whole apartment is sound-proof by the way,” as the next leg is lifted and attached. The cradle is more taunt than the upper and lower layers, obviously with almost *no give*, keep him spread obscenely *wide*.

Tim lets his head fall back, panting with it.

Dick maneuvers effortlessly, gorgeous naked, to grab onto a ring over his head and reach into a hidden pouch to pull a two buttoned remote (*what no Nightwing symbol?*). “I’m right here, baby. Look at me the whole time, okay? It’s going to get...*intense* your first time, but I’m right here with you,” the hand with the remote smoothes over his thigh, and Tim manages to tilt his head back up to look, and see the easy smile. A tiny *beep* and he forces himself to keep *watching* while his stomach drops and they *rise*.

His brain *knows* they’re in a condensed space, knows he’s not that high off the ground that a fall could kill him. The lower layer of straps is only a few feet from the carpet and taunt enough to catch him if something breaks, but his body only gets tighter with the anticipation and the distance seems like *miles*. The sheer weightlessness, the thin points of support, the slight pull to his wrists and ankles has his head falling back, panting.

Dick just rubs his thigh again with his free hand, supported only by his one-handed grip on a single ring. He slides the remote away, and like he demonstrated before, just an easy twist of hips and the vigilante’s legs rise over his head in an upside-down split with perfectly straight lines to loops his ankles in the top layer of straps over them, arching his spine in an incredibly flexible move to put his face right over the secured doctor.

“Talk to me, baby. Tell me where you’re at,” and because *Dick can do that*, he’s only holding himself up with his calves and knees easily, palming the side of Tim’s face to look closer at his pink cheeks and blown pupils.

*It’s not that far, it’s not that far, it’s not that far*\-- *don’t think about the possible fractures and contusions.*

“You could always distract me,” he rasps out, trying to get enough purchase to lift his hips, trying to find friction for his painfully hard cock. “That sounds nice right about now, I mean, it would be a shame to waste all the time well-spent *torturing me*\--”

But he’s only babbling because Dick’s smile is downright *sinful* (even upside down), and he moves with that careless power, like he could do this all day, flipping around Tim’s inert body, grabbing other straps to set them swaying lazily and slot himself right against Tim’s back, pressing the front of his body against his smaller lover, grips the restraining cradle above bound wrists, and slides his cock wetly in the cleft of Tim’s ass with a groan, lining up so the head catches at the place where it needs to *be*. Now, *right fucking now*.

“You’re killing me, *killing me*,” he moans out, his body swaying gently as he tries to work his hips, lets his head fall back against Dick’s shoulder. And pressed so *close* to Tim, with this incredible *trust* making his chest tight, only the thin bands between them, only held up by his own strength and the straps, he presses his mouth gently to the spot right between shoulder and neck, biting just slightly. So he can give the *deep*, hard thrusts Tim needs, Dick threads his legs into the straps right alongside Tim’s, arching a little so he can work. Tim’s mouth drops open automatically with the feel of all that strength, the tight muscles against his back and ass and thighs; he’s helpless to do anything but work his hips as best he can, try to get the angle right, try to get what his body is *desperate for*.

Wet and sharp against the nape of his neck, a laugh followed by a lick. Dick uses his leverage, pulling to create a terribly tight tension, holding Tim’s body still against movement, to finally start sliding inside him, filling him* up* until his body just fucking *unlocks* and he sinks further into the supporting straps and Dick’s unending strength.

It’s too much and not enough, helpless and weightless, his body on fire with it, and he bites down hard enough on his lower lip that doesn’t come just from the feel of Dick filling him up, but his thighs shake with the effort.

“Oh God, *oh God*, you feel so big inside me,” a stupid thing babbled out, his fingers, always precise, always steady, fumbling at the strap so he can just *hold on*. “Dick! Dick--*fuck*.”

“I’m right here, Tim. Right here with you,” breathed gently across his neck, ending on a groan.

But it’s just so *Dick,* slow and easy, making his body open, Dick taking his *time* no matter how *desperate *the noises are starting to sound. It’s with leverage and gentle swaying, lazy short thrusts until Dick is buried inside him to the *root*.

The only thing grounding him is the precarious skin and scars below him, held by a few straps, his eyes wet with the intensity of it all. His moan is helplessly aroused when he feels just the right kind of *full*.

“So *good*, baby. Damn, you’re so *tight* for me. Oh, God, I wanna fill you up so *bad*, but not yet, okay?” and it’s that lower register, the cock throbbing inside his body, doing *this* makes him bite down hard on his lower lip so he doesn’t start *begging*. Just a little shifting, giving Tim time to adjust to the rush to his senses, his vertigo, to let him ease down enough to move.

“I think you’ll have to take a week off and just stay here with me. Oh, Jay is going to *love this*.”

...a *week*? He bites down on his lip* harder* (but the noises spill out anyway--he can’t hold it *in*).

And with his incredible strength, Dick adjusts to grip another strap for a strategic pull, the strap holding him under his thighs releases enough for gravity to take over and pound Tim down *hard* to grind perfectly on the vigilante’s thick, hard cock. A surprised noise and his body undulates as the momentum starts-- a sweet drag out, with just the tip keeping the panting doctor open, Dick pulls easily on the straps to move Tim’s body so he can push back in.

When he gets a low, shaky groan, he gets validation he has Timmy in the perfect place, right where he *needs* his ridiculously smart, hot little boyfriend to be. He has to make Tim mindless to completely let *go* of his rigid control, *the doctor always ready for the next emergency*, to let Dick take him without holding *back*.

From the arch of that spine against his chest, the abrupt cry, he’d say he’s succeeding, and isn’t Jay going to be so fricking *jealous*.

The rhythm is slow and erotic, the glide getting *wetter*, and Dick flexes his thighs to bury himself as deep as he can, to open Tim up even *more*. He only needs one hand (not really, he could keep fucking Tim just with his thighs in the right place, but yes, *soon*) so the other can turn his baby’s face enough to see the open-mouthed panting, the glazed eyes hazy with pleasure. Dick groans and takes his mouth hard and wet, speeds up his thrusts because *perfect, their boy is absolutely ****perfect***.

In between thrusting tongues and the slick, quickening motions, he’s moaning after every thrust, a minute shift here and there until the tip of Dick’s cock hits his *spot* on the rolling glide back in, and he almost *screams* with it. His cock is throbbing and pleasure shoots up his spine, he’s weightless and helpless, and it’s *Dick*, so it’s *so fucking good*, his brain is frying because he can’t take anymore--he just needs to *come*.

“P-Please Dick, *please*.”

*Fuck, here he is begging anyway*.

Nuzzling below his ear to place absurdly gentle kisses while the rolling rhythm fills him *up* until the straps tremble in time with his thighs.

“Not yet, baby. Oh...*oh*, not yet. Ah, you’re so *tight* and *hot* around me, feels *so good*. I need more, just--*ah*, damn!--just a little more. You can hold out for me, can’t you Timmy? Just a *little bit more?*”

He’s turning into a keening mess, almost *sobbing*, but still, “fuck...*fuck*, yes. I’ll try, but, *oh, oh God*\--”

Something evil, the sound of a smirk against his jugular, “oh *baby*, I *know*, it feels so good, doesn’t it? Shh, shh, it’s okay. It’s okay, I’ll *help* you,” with a hard, deep, seating thrust making him see stars, and just *breathing? Who really needs to anyway?*

The glide out is slow and complete, making him literally *keen* when the heavy, hot tip pulls out of him wetly, leaving him unfathomably *empty* when the only thing he *needs right the fuck now*\--

Strategic pulls on straps and incredible feats of flexibility--Dick grinning wide, suddenly climbing between his restrained legs to share the cradle with him. One of those hands kneads his inner thigh, grounding him, bringing him back from the *brink*.

Tim’s too dazed, his brain a syrupy mess to put together the physics how Dick’s manages to get their hips aligned by bracing his feet on the shoulder strap much less get enough control to pull on another above his head and get Tim’s hips to tilt *up*. But the tip slides over him, wet and teasing, making his head fall back on his shoulders, and the rest is all about *need*.

He grips the straps he’s chained to, with it enough to shove his hips down on the next pass, earning a noise from both of them.

They move in some *psychic *agreement and meet on the next thrust, Dick gripping his hip with a free hand to rub soothing circles while things like gravity and kinky vigilante sex configurations literally make him *insane*.

He knows there is soothing words during the easy, rolling rhythm, knows Dick is asking if he’s okay (and *really, how do you expect him to answer ****that**** while ****this**** is a THING?*), but his brain is taken up with the feel of his body being filled over and over, of moving his hips to try and keep Dick buried deep enough that he forgets where he ends and Dick begins.

When the glide becomes *too much* again, and he’s going to come or break down and fucking *cry* or some shit, his chest is a shaking enough with panting breath that the straps at his back move, and he’s almost bitten a hole in his lip. Dick’s hand slides down his hip and leg without a hitch in the fluid, driving rhythm, fingers slide across the inside of his thigh to hold him, *ground him*.

“I can’t-- I *can’t*\--” and *fuck* his eyes are wet, but Dick buries himself *deep* right against Tim’s *spot* and he rears back to *scream*.

“Doing so well, Timmy, *fuck* you’re being so good, *so good* for me.”

A hard draw back, almost completely *out*, making Tim *wail* because *please, please, so close*\--

“Now, baby. *Now*.”

On the slide back in, *so fucking full*, he comes with his head back and his synapsis *exploding*. He’s a shaking, sweaty mess of a man, taking a series of slow, deep thrusts with tears running down his face, and meaningless noises spilling out of his chest until Dick buries himself *deep* a final time and fills him to the brim.

Dick’s ceiling fuzzes out and his eyes flutter, his pulse throbbing in the back of his throat, and the trembles of pleasure keep shooting up his spine, keeping him under where things are soft and fuzzy and warm. He’s not with it enough to feel the shift, the gentle sway of his body, Dick wet, thick cock slowly easing out. Everything sounds far away while his body comes down and he’s a mass of *useless as fuck*.

It’s fine though because Dick’s maneuvered to be literally hanging over him by his calf wrapped around a strap overhead. Warm hand on his face, tinny sound and moving lips, those blue eyes sparkling and *happy*, sated.

“Oh *baby*, I wore you out, didn’t I? Poor thing. I’m sorry, that was *a lot* so fast, wasn’t it?” And the furrow between Dick’s brows is a signal that *mother-henning* is about to start. “How about we get down and have cuddles for a while, hm?”

He thinks he probably hummed and didn’t even twitch at the clench of his stomach as they started to lower and Dick hangs over him, palming his face and cooing stupidly cute things about how brave he is for trying this, how much Dick enjoyed making love to him, how good he felt and how beautiful he was when he came so hard.

He stares up at those eyes, dazed and pliant and about as *fucked out* as you could possibly *get*. Which is why he completely lets Dick unclip the cuffs, pick him up like a fainting damsel, and take them both to the big inviting bed in the corner so he can just stay under and let himself float.

He briefly remembers drinking cool water from a straw and something tasty being fed to him so all he had to do was open and chew. There’s a warm wet cleaning him up at some point, but he finally goes completely under to the soft noise of the television, and the steady rhythm of Dick’s heart under his ear.

The only time he wakes up is when another warm body slides into bed with them, and the familiar scent of cigarettes and brimstone makes him sigh in contentment and tolerate the low, amused chuckle against his forehead, deciding on retribution for another night. Because now he’s bracketed between two large vigilantes and nothing short of an emergency is going to make him move an *inch*.
