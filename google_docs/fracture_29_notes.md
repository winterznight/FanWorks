Chapter 29

(When I said the plot was literally killing me, I was not just whistling Dixie, okay? Just *so much*. Thanks to my muse, Arkeadia. There was poking. A lot of poking because I’m a bad author and jumped into other, ah, things? A Blind!Tim thing, a Doctor!Tim fun thing, an AOB thing, just...branching out? I’m a little ashamed my baby, the place where it all got started kind of fell to the wayside. But did I mention *the plot was killing me slowly*.)

(End note: The whole “forces motivating the universe to keep doing this to him?” Yeah, it’s me XD #sorrynotsorry Tim. Ah, how many things can I *possibly* squeeze into one chapter \*gestures.\* Oh, recent Tumblr post I happened to see—something to the tune of Dick Grayson isn’t some weepy, super emotional hug monster, he’s pretty badass. Well, yes, yes he is, so have badass Dick Grayson, please. Give him mad props for his own long and sordid past in and out of the cape. And *finally*, my love, Azazels helped me put down the specifics behind the Architect forever ago, and it’s finally!! here.)

Of all the places he *expected* to end up tonight, on his back with Dick Grayson’s hips between his thighs was not among the top *five* (nope, that’s a *whole different *Top Five).

However, that is *exactly* what happens.

(And whatever forces motivating the universe to keep *doing* this to him? Really just need to *fuck off and die*).

\*\*

It’s five hours until the Bats can move in full regalia, and it’s going to be the longest five hours *of his fucking life* (and *yes,* he’s pretty sure Jason is right on *that* train with him). It’s not going to be a *happy* five hours, but things still need to be put in place.

Like, *a lot* *of shit needs done*.

According to the tracker in Dick’s standard-issue GCPD body armor (because *B*, who has several more in the gear of other GCPD officers and explained it to him one time as *that much back-up means something is going down and I probably want ****in***), he’s been moved back toward Gotham proper, stopping at the warehouse district (probably being “stored” until better transport arrives). The real question is if the bad guys are keeping Dick because having a cop as a hostage is always a little more “insurance” or… possibly to be used as leverage to get what they want out of holding the ward of Bruce Wayne (*and*, *you know, *now he’s got every reason to bitch at Dick—*for life*).

With the Titans on video chat, Robin en route, and Hood taking a look around the GCPD database, he’s running an algorithm on traffic and security cameras and very carefully *not* thinking about the *possibilities* (but, *well*, there’s a little *more* to the story, isn’t there? They could be waiting to get him to the docks, put *Dick* on a fucking ship and—).

(*Nope*. *Not. Fucking. Happening.*)

And B?

“I’ll be there in less than fifteen.”

B is putting on a terribly tacky suit and mustache because Matches Malone is very, *very* cozy in the warehouse district of Gotham City.

He’s going to get their eyes and ears on the inside.

Before the terrible suit went on and the Matches persona came to the fore, Tim was unceremoniously pulled away from the (*his*) workbench and laptop, directed by one of B’s palm between his shoulder blades while he starts laying out his side of what Hood designated *Plan: Get to Dickie’s Stupid Ass* (now...all he needs to do is convince them he’s good, or sneak out of the Cave once they’re all gone, whichever becomes necessary). B stops them by the fabrication space and—

*Really now?*

He’s feeling more of the damn warm fuzzies, and the Bats really aren’t even *trying*.

“I thought Alfred was going to put you down for a nap, Bruce,” Tim managed to deadpan even though the new suit already on a mannequin figure looks pretty *boss* (because, well, the Batfamily has a *knack* for this kind of thing) and B might have done it while he was passed the hell out in his *room*. You know, the one still upstairs.

Or, as usual, the Bat had the suit ready for “just in case.” It makes him feel oddly warm, knowing he was part of Bruce’s absent *contingencies* again.

“Did I mention your armor shattered?” B counters conversationally with an arched brow and just—

*Fuck*. He’s grinning up while they’re surrounded on all sides with a *hell* of a list and very little time to *work* all the details, and it’s just so *familiar* and a constant theme in their partnership, their *lives* that he laughs out loud, one hand against the bandages under his t-shirt.

“I expected the opposite reaction,” he wipes at his eyes and approaches the suit, eyes everything (wondering how many trackers are in it) and notes the lack of cowl, but domino and full cape instead of a place for his wing pack. It’s a slight deviation from his Gotham usual, but...*damn* if he doesn’t really *like* it. “I mean, don’t get me wrong. I fully intend to be out there with Dick compromised, but I was pretty sure you’d try to fight me on it.”

B arches a very unimpressed eyebrow, “We’ve met before, you realize. At one time, I could have grounded you, put you here to work out the back-end processes, but if I try it *now*, you’re out of this Cave in twenty minutes flying solo.”

*Welcome Home*.

“I might still remember some useful ways to sneak out.”

“Mmhm. I’m sure, but do you really think I’m going to let you do anything in a ripped up suit with busted armor and malfunctioning equipment?” That brow goes up even higher. “Also against the criminal who sold you out?”

And B sees the reaction, *knows* Tim is trying very, *very* hard to hold it together, but the World’s Greatest Detective can see all the evidence might finally be settling in. Even with Dick playing the helpless card, a new group of supervillains, and a Black Market meta-tech dealer on their horizon, he has a moment to bask in Tim standing back in the Cave, staying in the Manor where he’s always had a place.

B feels good about how far they’ve come considering eight months ago, Tim had removed himself from the BI database without a hitch, certain no one would even give a damn.

Well, he knows better now, and that is enough for B to count this situation (criminals and injuries notwithstanding) as a win.

“Technically, Shaw isn’t going to know it’s *me*, Bruce.”

“Semantics.”

He almost says it. *Almost*. But the grin almost cracks his jaw because, *c’mon now*. He takes the undersuit prototype to put on until time to fly.

“And this if you insist on going,” from beside the suit—a Batcomm.

A *new* Batcomm…with the Red Robin symbol on the side piece.

And he can’t help but *stare* at it in B’s palm, finds himself blinking rapidly for no good fucking *reason* other than Bruce making something specifically with him in mind (and a new suit...B made him a suit with *his* logo and a workstation with a laptop and...the tape is still on the *fucking ceiling*).

He takes it, smirking a little to cover his ass, but yeah, that’s his voice cracking just a little, just *enough*, “aw, the gifts that just keeps on giving.”

But Bruce sees it, how Tim’s expression changes, just a flicker before settling into neutral lines, and *no*, he doesn’t need him to spell it out; how *much* it all is. Jason seemed to go through the same sort of shellshock his first few days back in the Manor, once the *realizations* started to hit: Jason’s room remained the same, just with some upgrades; the books he favored stayed in the same places he hid in to get a few spare moments to read (and yes, that’s Edumund Spenser’s *The Faerie Queen* still niched above one kitchen window, and God only knew how many times he and Alfred looked up to see just a corner sticking out, Jason the last one who touched it), and, of course, the glass case in the Cave.

And just like he did with Robin #2, he moves to pull Robin #3 in by the shoulders, resting his chin on top of Tim’s head, Tim who was slightly taller, Tim who was all muscle and sinew, not as broad as he’d been back when B gave him the Red Bird and the Carriage House (it would be fine, Alfred weighed him when he was down for the count after the bullets and shrapnel came out—if anyone was going to get him back to peak weight, it would be one Alfred Pennyworth). It takes him back to a haunted, too-thin Red Hood, standing close to the same spot with the same painful expression (and it had taken time for the Red Hood to step back and Jay to start peeking around the edges of the mask). Jason had been taller, more skittish. Tim is all snark and having his next moves ready—anything outside the realm of his contingencies enough to break through *Red* and get to *Tim*.

“The suit is full of trackers, isn’t it?”

Bruce hums in reply and obligingly lets Tim step back when he’s had enough. “The Titans sent me the design, you can blame them.”

Of course they did. At least he’ll know how to reprogram them if necessary. “Rats. Foiled again.”

B runs a hand down his face to cover up the laugh. “All right. O is going to be back online within the hour. Alfred probably gave her an ultimatum too. Let her help you coordinate. As much as I know you won’t, try to keep yourself on the lighter details. Besides,” a pointedly *not* subtle eye slide to Jason’s broad back. And the two of them, him and B, exchange *the look*.

Because standing at the big computer, he’s already in the Red Hood body suit for the night sans jacket, holsters, and domino (it’s fucking *unfair* while he’s trying to put a whole lot of things into *place*), mouth turned down in the whole *gloom and doom* usually reserved for B. But, Tim *gets it*. Even though Dick was *the first* of them, was a detective, an ass kicker, worked undercover, saved them all time and time again, was *motherfucking Batman*, he still feels the twinges of fear in the lower part of his abdomen at the thought of Dick in the hands of terrorists. None of it is any better as the live footage of the prisoner being loaded and Officer Grayson hopping in the passenger seat of the armored vehicle (and yes, the three of them sigh in tandem when Dick glances over his shoulder and winks at the direction of the camera—you know, *like an asshat*, before he’s pulling the door closed) is playing on the Batcomputer’s main screen. .

“All right,” was B’s first observation, “we need *everything*.”

Which included Matches Malone to meander down in his part of town and make a little *magic* happen.

Once the whole terribly tacky ensemble goes on, Tim keeps a straight face, but damn if it isn’t a stretch. He goes back to the top of (his) the workbench where the utility belt is the next thing to get stocked up, glancing at the working screen of the laptop and all the usual processes kicking ass.

He’s in WE’s database (getting another annoying reminder of the Gala in a few days for that one charity he supports—please Tam, just *stop killing him slowly*) to pick up the particulars on the stolen tracking devices in the meta-tech, checking the back doors for hack attempts while Dami is tapping into the pilfered data for more deets on the *who* and *how* and maybe a little *when* thrown in.

He also has a few pings on security cams, but nothing to show how or when the prisoner exchange went south or if the other officer with Dick managed to get out alive. He has no other faces to try tracking or any vehicle information if they didn’t make a switch-out (then again, smart criminals aren’t going to be drive an GCPD INMATE TRANSPORTATION van willy-nilly around a city like Gotham). Jason has the police radio playing low, waiting for the GCPD to pick-up on the jailbreak to find out more deets. Until they get something else, the tracker in Dick’s armor is all they have to go on.

Also running is the mirror application to the research LAN in Titan’s Tower (and *yes*, he’s scrubbing this laptop when he’s done with it. The Bats already get into his systems without his own *help*) so he can get an eyeful of his team working their own sides of the case because, *you know*, bad guys aren’t going to catch themselves.

Scans indicate Kon is back up to (“100% all bad ass.” “Or whiny-ass, but who’s counting?” “Aw, *dude*. Do you need some water for that burn?”) normal. Cassie already has butterfly bandages on her knuckles (Rave), Bart looks none the worse for wear after a little bit of a stroll, and his favorite couple were playing at the usual intel gathering/mother-henning the rest of the group. He then checks to make sure the tech is *safely* stowed (this time) and deactivated without the power source. The microchip from WE is scanning for any unknown alterations (even though he’s pretty sure he’s good on all the deets—nope, the *real* question is *how* they got a hold of his tech and if it means they’ve got the passcodes needed to activate WETMS).

(Still, he’s going to eventually need to check the physical inventory, *in person*, once other emergencies of the night are dealt with—*Dick*)

B has already put the Batcomputer to work with the Batplane’s database of information from the last few weeks’ worth of investigating.

From his own laptop, he’s in the center, making sure everyone gets *just enough* but not too much to put it all together (welp, except *Cassie* who already suspects his theory the Triad is still out there might be more than just a *theory*)—or so he thought.

“All right,” B flips the keys to a terribly tacky Monte Carlo that is exactly the right look for Matches and draws the two of them out of appropriate sleuthing, “here’s how we’re gonna run it. Once I’m down, I’ma hitcha up wid’ the skinny. ‘Til I do, we need ta know who ‘dis Shaw character’s been talkin’ ta.”

Jason’s eyes go wide and a hand over his mouth tells B everything he needs to know. *Yup. Nailed it*.

Tim is biting into his lip, very pointedly *not* saying anything to get himself in trouble when B with the veneer of Matches Malone turns narrowed eyes on him.

“An’ Jase is gonna run front ‘n center, Red. Y’ hear dat? Let ‘em do da heavy liftin’ so’s dose hurts don’t start up again, ya feel me? Dem *fuck*holes getcha drop on ya and we’s got *two* birds down.”

Now he’s trying so hard not to laugh, just *so hard* because right now isn’t really the time for it and just, *B*, you’re leaving him with Hood after all that? Jason stays facing the Batcomputer, but in the lower half of the screen, he can see the reflected expression of frustrated fondness that could really be a knife to the throat or a good discussion of Harper Lee and why people are *fucking Philistines, Timmy*. So he’s going to go with *all good* and waves B off to Matches’ ride while he absently moves the new undersuit on his workstation to the side to get into soon as he’s sure everything is caught up enough to step away from the working laptop for a few minutes.

He doesn’t see Jason look over his shoulder to catch Bruce’s gaze, a nod between the two in understanding. He also doesn’t see Jason’s phone lighting up with incoming texts, Diana assuring him the JLA is moving to get the littles gathered together and moved to the Watchtower, and her string of emojis when she wishes them *happy hunting*.

That’s Di for you, always spoiling for the next fight.

It’s why they’re BFFs, really.

The Red Hood smirks when he puts up his phone, a few more things in the works while the tracker just eases for a while. His eyes move over Tim’s hunched form as he processes and analyzes on his laptop, working the angles ‘cause Baby Bird is all about being on top his shit. Well, he ain’t the *only* Bat what tries to get the drop on nasty mother*fuckers* (and like he don’t know how Dickie *thinks*, like he don’t know his fine-ass boy is trying to find out if they’re up against the baddies that kidnapped Timmy in the *first fucking place*. Ain’t the only detective in the *family*, you feel me?). Hood has already started tracing a hell of a lot of in-coming ships to the two harbors in Gotham while the police radio plays in the background. Since Demon’s got WE systems literally in his fucking hands, Hood can get the deets on the kidnappers to put the picture together on the Bat-side of the house.

And if he finds out Timmy has been doing some crazy shit, like hiding the White Triad bastards from them, he was gonna get the ass-kicking of a *lifetime* (and his arms know the feel of gripping Tim hard through the few flashbacks he’d let them witness, Baby Bird’s voice a hoarse mess when he recounted the two weeks he’d been on that ship while he and Dickie sat on the ledge of that building and kept him between them).

When he’d finally given *in* some, just enough to let them in, and taking into account he hasn’t tried hitting the door yet, plan’s looking *good*. They keep Baby Bird close enough to make sure they know where he’s *at*, keep a keen eye on the deets he’s trying to keep on the ‘low (which is inevitably where he’s going to take off for at the first possible *fucking moment*. Timmy’s a master of redirection. Ain’t gonna work this time, asshole. We *getchu* now).

Another eye dance, and he unintentionally gets a recount of skin and scars, the flush pink on his chest, the way he’d bitten his lip—

And Jason? He’s a man what *knows* the look of *want*, when a man’s got to turn away, to *deflect*, to *hide*, so no one else knows what’s doing, so he can hide what he needs, what he feels, can hide when he *likes* what he *sees*.

And everything from that scene less than a few hours ago in Tim’s bathroom tells Jason Todd he’s done a *whole lot* of passing shit off that shoulda oughta been evidence he and Dickie needed to get the ball rolling with Timmy’s fine ass. The half-hard cock, the deflection when Jay caught ‘im *touching*, it was the final evidence he needed to believe there was *more* than the smart ass affection in their bird. And *fuck* if he hadn’ta almost *missed it*. In trying to be careful and considerate, in trying to avoid the shit that would scare him back out into the world or make him run full speed back to the Titans, all their workings to make sure Tim knew he was safe in Gotham, all of it made them blind to those little cues.

As B made last adjustments to the hidden catches in Matches’ suit, Jason is side-eyeing Timmy with the smallest of smirks while Baby Bird gets all his ducks in a row.

But now that he *realizes*, now that he *gets it*, gets where Tim’s been for a while, can take a second to run down the clues, look back at the smallest details of their interactions through the months, he berates himself silently on being a seriously *shitty* Detective, yeah? And it ain’t just the fact Baby Bird got half-hard just from a look. Naw, a lotta things that have been nagging at him, catching right in his brain pan and whirling about, shit he’d just *passed off* as wishful-fucking-thinking are starting making a whole lotta *sense*. The more comfortable Baby Bird had been getting with them and casual touches, an arm around his shoulders, a grip to the wrist, a niche right in his lap during the bad episodes. And Jason can mentally track the more Tim’s body language and nonverbal cues had unintentionally given him away all this mother*fucking* time.

He and Dickie are the dumbasses that didn’t take it at face value, wanting to do the right thing. It made more sense when the excess trackers in their uniforms showed up, the data provided via email before a case started getting messy, the more frequent trips into Gotham, the subtle pauses when clothes came off to treat injuries. All the small things that had missed his notice, or been explained in some other medium, gives Jason something else to *think about* instead of gnaw more on the worry still deep in his guts for Dickie’s assured health.

Instead, with the division of his attention, he plans out how he’s going to pull it together for Dick so they can come up with a little *something* that might have to happen after they help Timmy blow this case open *wide*.

(And he’s going to remind Dick of the *look* Tim gave him while he was too honest riding blood loss and injuries down in the Cave, he’s gonna make Dick *think* about all those aborted moves and bitten lips in the last few weeks, and he going to make Dick a *believer*—that they can *have*.)

The side plot gives him the satisfaction he needs to keep himself from doing anything to break the ring of work going down, lets himself call out updates, and listen to whatever new move is happening between Tim’s working hands. He can keep the running details coming together, can be the Red Hood while his boy is out in his daytime skin in the clutches of murders and thieves.

He can give a hitched nod to B on his way to be a scummy low-life and not make it too *obvious* how much he likes looking once Tim comes back from putting on just the Red Robin body suit. He manages, but it ain’t as easy as it *sounds* (‘cause he already *knows* where the catches and latches are on that baby, you betcha *ass* his fingers give a twitch like he’s already across the Cave to take it right *off*).

But if anything, Jason Todd is a man that knows how that thing called *patience*? That shit pays off in the end, and once they get Dickie back, take down these dirty mother*fuckers*, teach ‘em a lesson on fucking with the *wrong* CEO, well, their reward is gonna be So. Fucking. *Sweet*.

Behind them, the Monte Carlo purrs on the way out while a sly, satisfied smile slowly curves Jason’s mouth.

\*\*

*—The Architect—*

It’s become *more* than a distraction between rounds of *agony*, of what she would do if she could only *be free*.

Now, that she is, it’s a *mission*.

The concepts of *time* in contrast to *space* along with a defined, calculated set of actions and associated reactions, are key determiners in the path of the future. The Architect is one that *knows* this, knows this down to her *bones*. (Bones that have been broken, bones that have been twisted, turned to *dust* in the pursuit for their *perfect weapon*).

And to alter the paths to the future, to use the *power* of time and space, the Architect must have patience—must be able to use all the tools at her disposal, cannot leave anything, even the smallest occurrence, to chance. To weave a future free of torment, free of destruction and downfall, it’s necessary to go back into the past, to map out the exact events making the future stray away from her desired course. Once those events are *altered*, the future smooths out, combines into *one*.

Her objective will be complete.

No more *bad days*.

No more dying parents and planets, no more sick, *twisted* criminals holding the world hostage. No more experimentation on *children.* It will be a future without the need of vigilantes and superheroes, a world without evil, a world without agony and torment and suffering. A world where the heroes can be *free*. A world where all the innocent people hurt in the wars waged between good and evil, light and darkness, twisted and serene, can live without fear.

To accomplish the goal, it has become an unfortunate necessity to work with the worst kinds—the ones the Architect is ultimately fighting against. It’s not the preferred method, not what is *wanted*, but rather what is *needed*. The evildoers of the world helping to alter the timelines for what they believe is *their* ideal futures will be disappointed once the final alterations are put into place.

For a long time, for *so long*, the Architect has worked in the time streams to find the breaking points, all the minute details and decisions that caused a *fracture*, a delineation, a multiverse—and those multiverses would have a future based on that tiny, seemingly insignificant deviation, that *choice*.

This only makes the Architect’s job, the ultimate *goal* that much more difficult to achieve, for those multiverses must also be mapped, be altered, be redirected just as the Architect has designed. Zoom and the Anti-Flash, Lex Luthor and Vandal Savage are only a few that have joined in the effort; when the Architect approached them with the master plan, they believed they were working toward eradicating their nemeses, creating a future in which *they* could rule without opposition. No super aliens, no metahumans, no Bats, no Arrows, no Speedsters, no Angels or Demons, no legacies for the next generation of heroes. Behind and around and under and to the sides of them, the Architect plots other points without their knowledge, begins to connect their courses along with everyone *else*—factors in the instances that made them what they *are*, and plans on making them *better, *to either conform to the inevitability.

Or be erased.

Once all the nuances are complete, all the events that *will be* are triggered, the multiverses will collapse and finally, *finally* converge into a singular timeline. And her job, her *mission*, will be complete.

She will create a utopia. A future that will never want for justice. A world that will never know the kind of destruction and degradation she’s experienced in her own line, that she’s seen in others—*countless *others. A world that will be, by definition, *perfect.* Once all the plotted points are discovered, once the Architect has set the stage for those events to *change*, only one remaining event will be the catalyst for the great downfall. One action is all it will take, and for that, well, she has, ironically, plenty of *time*.

\*\*

His nose itches.

It *really* itches.

Humming to himself, Officer Grayson shifts just slightly, wiggling his nose in an attempt to alleviate the annoyance since his hands are bound behind him (*kinky*) and he can’t just slip the impressive zip ties to get the itch even though it *really* wouldn’t be a problem.

After the five very obvious out-of-towners did the usual bad guy thing by setting up a trap in the center of the highway en route to Central City (in which Dick hadn’t said a word about to Inigo because *vigilante jackpot*), he’d given them the standard, calm, “I’m a police officer, don’t make this worse for yourself” speech of which Inigo himself had just sighed and been the one to take his gun, restrain his arms then shove a bag over his head.

Of course, having one of their people infiltrate GCPD meant Shaw is more important than he or Jason initially theorized, so getting himself maybe a little *caught* keeps getting to be a better and better plan.

They ditch the inmate transport and throw him in the back of a panel van in time to hear:

“You *can’t* do this! You swore if I took the fall you’d leave them *alone*. I’ve been serving time so you’d leave them the *hell alone*—”

“Unfortunately, plans change.” Another voice tisks, “and we are in need of your expertise again.”

“Are you *kidding? *You just broke me out of *jail*. They’ll be looking for me everywhere, there’s no way I can hack into—”

“That’s very sad news for Mary and little Jenny then, isn’t it?”

And he *hears* it for himself, the tinny quality from a mobile phone, crying, young and middle-aged. Every instinct, everything that makes him a vigilante comes to the *fore*.

“You fucking *bastards*—” But Shaw is choking, probably staring at his wife and child with fear and horror.

And this? This changes some things *up*.

“They were easy to find, Johnny. Do this for us, and you’ve got a new ident, a ticket to Costa Rica, and your family. It’s a generous offer.”

He hears Shaw choke, the rattle of his manacles.

“All right, Grayson,” Inigo interrupts the monologue from the front of the van, giving Dick the distraction he needs to move his arms just slightly and press on the back of his GCPD vest to activate the camera. One more tap to the pocket in his gunbelt and the recording device also starts (and well, when they take the gun belt, he might be lucky enough that they keep it in an important place so he can get even *more* evidence for the Commish—who started bitching to B about the capes making his guys *lazy*).

“I don’t know what you’re doing with these guys, Inigo,” and Dick has to be *careful* how he plays this, has to *seem* like he has no idea what the underlying story is, has to seem like he just stumbled into a much bigger picture (and if he’s *very lucky*, he might even get a bad guy monologue revealing their *evil* plans), “but there’s still a *chance* to get out of this before anyone gets hurt. Let me help you.”

“Yada, yada, yada. Sorry, man, I picked sides long before I ever met you.”

“If it’s the side of good guys with donuts, then you’ve chosen right. Since it doesn’t really *appear*—”

“Don’t you ever shut the fuck up?”

“Haven’t you ever heard wit is a sign of intelligence?”

“Silence is a sign you’re going to live to see tomorrow. Look, Grayson, you know the routine. Don’t make any trouble or I’ll probably just shoot you to avoid any future problems.”

“*Man*, and I was so looking forward to inviting you to our weekly poker game. The disappointment is overwhelming.”

“I should have fucking gagged you. Damn, I knew it.”

He shrugs it off, slipping the zip tie this time to palm a few pellets, getting himself back in them easy. “Well, you could come to confession and tell Father Grayson why you’re involved with these terrible men instead.” *C’mon, c’mon, you ****know**** you want to give me the deets.*

“This has nothing to do with you. It was just your bad luck they put you on my detail or you’d still be at the station with your damn donuts.”

He *could* go for a vanilla creme one right about now— no, no, *focus Dick*, yummies later. “Honestly, I *do* have the worst luck,” and Inigo might not be able to see him smiling, but he most certainly *is*.

Inigo’s quiet for a few seconds,“You seem alright, Grayson, so as long as you keep quiet and don’t cause trouble, we’ll leave you somewhere safe. The GCPD can find you after we’re gone.”

Dick almost hums to himself because *sure they are*. Inigo really isn’t instilling any confidence in a hostage he wants to *behave*. But, he needs to stay around long enough to find out where they’re keeping John’s family. If he takes them down too soon, stops a check-in, the hostages would be dead before he could trace them, and that’s something Dick can’t chance. Instead, he has to make himself valuable somehow.

So, time for a different angle. “You know why I joined your detail last minute, Inigo?” And he makes it with a slight *edge*, some reality in with the game he’s playing. “I *asked* for it.”

The bad guy, at first, seems pretty lost, “is this supposed to be going somewhere—?”

“The prisoner we were transporting is serving time for cyber crimes against Wayne Enterprises.” He turns his head in the direction of Inigo’s face, the guy probably leaning against the back seat, gun trained on him. “I’m Bruce Wayne’s *ward*. C’mon, man, put it together.”

There it is. The *ah-ha*.

He smirks at the noticeable pause (oh yeah, let’s see if WE happens to get their hair up because *then* he gets the Detective Gold Star Award—sorry, Timmy). There’s shifting of cloth, movement and low voices, an undercurrent of something new. Dick almost shakes his head a little (it’s so, so easy sometimes, dangle a little bit of bait in front of them and wait for it) since well, *gotcha*.

“I gotta say, Grayson, I’m surprised. Huh, and here I thought you might be just another pretty face.” But now Inigo is musing, turning over the information and how they might be able to use a completely *different* son of Wayne’s to get what they *need*.

And while he didn’t see the blow to the back of the head coming, he feel the creeping presence of the guy in the seat behind him shift; Dick forces himself not to tense up with it, to move just enough to make it look convincing

\*\*

Kon...is not feeling much better with *this* little twist.

“Okay, so, let me just get this down,” and he idly looks back over the stolen tech that was just, you know, *stuck to his fucking arm and shit*, one that negated his powers… and gave him something altogether *different*, heavy, nauseating, something he was just trying to keep controlled while Cassie was trying to get the damn thing the hell *off* him (and okay, more lab safety procedures—Rave totally has a point this time since *thou shalt not put on wicked-looking bad guy tech* isn’t part of the standard protocol).

“It can do *more*,” Cassie repeats from her spot by the holoscreens, reading over the results. “It can apparently instill the meta gene and supplement whatever genetic markers the programmers want. I mean, it’s basically messing with your DNA. I don’t even *know*—”

All eyes turn to him, and even for a super, he feels a little sick and looks down at one slightly trembling hand with wide eyes. With his already unstable DNA, with how much Luthor and Cadmus have already *fucked* with him—Kon swallows back the sour taste in his mouth, closes his eyes, and breathes out slowly.

“Kon,” Tim’s voice over the intercom, “chillax, dude. It’s the usual bad guy rigmarole. The tech isn’t meant to leave permanent changes, *but*, we’re going to play it safe and do a diagnostic, right?”

Blinking owlishly, the teenager nods firmly (and it’s…weird that he suddenly wants Clark there just-just *because* it would be nice and all).

“Gar,” Cassie starts calmly, smiling gentle even though it doesn’t reach her eyes the whole way, but her soothing *it’s okay, we’re going to handle it* still makes Kon feel less shaky, “could you and Bart—?”

The two of them are already moving to Superboy from their positions in the lab before she needs to finish that sentence—oh yeah, they need to get their boy scanned, need to know he’s not going to suffer any effects from *this*. Gar is all easy *hey, buddy, no problems, ‘kay?* And Bart looks his usual combination of sassy and worried once someone on the team takes a hit (magic and weird bi-tech notwithstanding).

“All right, bro. Let’s hit the med floor and do some scans, right?”

“C’mon, we’re with you, man. It would be *nice* if you would stop—I don’t know—getting your DNA messed with, but we’ll just handle it like *usual*.” Bart’s hand is just above the inside of his bicep, pulling him along to the elevator.

From the main screen, Tim’s eyes move with the three to the elevator. He’s already remotely warming up equipment in the med floor and setting up the tests he wanted—the usual *have a plan for that shit* mentality.

Cassie turns to come closer to the screen, Raven joining her as they bring their results and observations.

“Finding the creators will be more difficult than we first imagined,” Raven flicks her fingers, bring up scans of the gauntlet’s schematics. “We have found little that could lead us to a culprit. The materials, the technological components. We are fortunate the two of you could even identify the power source to free Conner.”

“I’ve almost got the memory storage unlocked so we can look at the programming.” Cassie sighs, her eyes flickering back to the elevator.

“I’ve never seen anything like it. The tech just isn’t even *close* to this,” Tim admits as soon as his bestie is being carted away for his own good. “Even Luthor isn’t anywhere close to this kind of genetic alteration on the fly. I mean *bam* put it on and you’re a superhero.”

“Or a supervillain,” Raven replies idly.

“Well, they *do* have cookies,” his voice echoes over the connection while he’s looking at the prosthetic code and…

“Oh,” Cassie says nearly the same time he puts it together.

In the Cave, Tim almost falls down in the chair by his work station, *staring*.

“Baby Bird?”

Jason’s boots don’t shake him out of a fast scan to double-check the findings.

His voice is low, pained, “in addition to this extreme gravity controlling ability, the prosthetic can be programmed to instill other powers in the wearer…specifically telepathy, shape-shifting, and-and technomancy.”

That pulls Jason up short, makes Raven turn from the tracking screen, seeking out the Insidious Seven— her eyes go to the station Gar was at, the labs Tim had traced and all the data collected, *used* to make these *abominations* from children (*their *children).

Cassie’s loose hands fist *tight* while she reads the same results with narrowed eyes (and what those *bastards* did in order to make this-this *thing*).

“I think we know who gave the creators of this piece of *crap* all the data on the meta genes,” he deadpans, looking over at Jason’s tilted head. “This fine product is sponsored by the assholes in charge of Project Genesis.”

Tim whips his phone out, already dialing Miguel and hoping Wally was just, you know, *hanging out*.

“Mother*fucker*,” Jason snatches his phone up and bends down over his shoulder to read over the findings, “Di and Supes a’ already on it, Timmy. Gathering the little shits as we speak.”

Well, *family of detectives*, right?

“The genetic coding of each Meta gene matches certain marker of the kids, Jay. They may not have built it, but Praesidium provided all the necessary data.”

(And *no*, he’s not going to think about how *close* Jay is to him right now, and if Tim literally just *turned his head*, he could just open his mouth and bite down on Jason’s jugular, and *why the ****fuck**** is he*—shit)

A deep breath, *woo-sa*. *Woo-saaaaaa*.

He misses the pleased, teasing smirk on Jason’s face even while the older vigilante leans slightly lower, closer to the laptop screen that “inadvertently” puts his chest against Tim’s shoulder while he inhales the findings from Titan’s Tower.

And...even if it makes him an asshole, like the *worst* person in existence (because *hello*, this is Dick’s *boyfriend* and he wouldn’t *hurt* Dick like this), the simple contact, the warmth and solid weight of Jason, the sigh of their suits sliding, the heavier, broader touch— it’s more than he’s had in...so long, *too* long, and it’s an easy thing to relax back into it, to lean back on a solid, grounding touch.

But even if it ain’t the right *time*, Jason sees those eyes fall half-mast for just a blink, just long enough to *catch*. The subtle cues again, Tim leaning back into his shoulder and arm where he’s got a hand braced on the back of the chair with his phone still in the other hand. It must be the day for epiphanies or some shit because now he can *see* how Baby Bird is bordering on *touch-starved* (even with Dickie’s more constant hugs and grips, an’ well, he’d been a lying *fucker* if he said his own body didn’t *know* the feel of Timmy’s skin and breath and heartbeat…yeah, he hadn’t put much stock in how it had become more of a *thing*, reaching out, pulling him in, not letting him wiggle away until he’d finally stopped *trying*), so’s it’s a good thing he’s got not one but *two* vigilantes that want to do a whole lot of *giving back*.

It’s hard not to let himself tilt a lil’ more so he can rub his five-o’clock against Timmy’s throat to let ‘im get nice and bothered. (But, since alla ‘em are big inta havin’ *evidence* before they go sprouting a theory—maybe he needs just a lil’ bit more what ta *convince* himself)

The screen in front of them pops up a new alert, one with results of Super clone’s tests. Baby Bird doesn’t feel like he’s gotta straighten up or nothing, just let himself be braced. So maybe Timmy *needs* more than he originally thought.

The security cams show Kon is shirtless, hanging out in one of the stasis tubes while the lights flash around him, finishing the scans.

Gar already had the saliva samples going through the usual rigmarole of “standard” testing, but hey, at least there’s an app for that. Which is why he’s scanning his phone idly, his side plastered against the glass above Kon. On the other side, Bart is leaning his back against it, talking to the clone over one shoulder.

“Everything is looking normal on this front too, dude. I think you’re in the clear.” Gar looks up to give his version of a charming smile, but...it falls a little short. The issue of Kon’s unstable DNA had come up in the past, just the standard *oh no, I’m powerless for a minute* or the *hey, I can actually fly this time*. Gar and Bart are *aware* and concerned. (Once the guy left, one of them would activate the Charlie Lima October November Echo protocol to make *sure* the guy was on watch. Seriously, no injured or out-of-control supers needed at present).

“Agreed. Spectro says there’s no difference between your last sample,” is Tim’s cautious, disembodied voice from the speakers, “how do you feel, man? This is a no bullshit zone right now.”

Gar and Bart move accommodatingly while Bart uploads results to the Team Drive and Gar helps a bro out by popping the hatch.

“I mean—I was not a fan, dude. Zero stars, would not want to wear again.”

“All right. Why not jump down to the training floor and start trying to hit your peak power output and we’ll compare data just to be sure. As far as we know, the prosthetic negates an existing the Meta gene for it’s programming, but doesn’t otherwise affect the whole system.”

Gar and Bart follow him to the elevators, the steady sound of Tim’s echoy typing (and *yes*, it’s not really a secret where that guy is atm. Bats totally get a gold star) following them down to the training deck.

“That sounds like some freakishly scary weaponry we should be tracking down.”

“If we find any of the Insidious Seven, then we follow them to whoever made the device.”

“Systems are running for possible labs that are even *close* to this level of design. My top *five* aren’t even in the running and that includes LexCorp and Wayne Tech.”

Bart massages his forehead and holds up a bro fist for Kon on his way to the training deck while he and Gar continue back to Raven and Cassie.

“Those rejects from Cadmus are probably doing something with their time,” he fills in shortly after Kon stepped off. “We already went through Praesidium systems for as many of their suppliers and buyers as possible.”

The intercomm systems clicks when it picks up Raven’s voice to broadcast, “we did not, however, find the source of their funding. The project is a long-running one, keeping the children,” (and *no,* she does not call them *The Littles*, not as formidable as they are), “for several years. Someone would need to be backing their research and facilities, providing them the necessary tools to make the weaponry centered on the Meta gene.”

Tim’s sighs out hard, eyes narrow while he thinks and more processes move across his screen. He only blinks slightly when Jason lifts the hand braced on his chair to grip his shoulder and squeeze before straightening up to go back to the big computer (and he totally does *not* shiver at the feel of Jason’s jaw sliding, *scratching* along the base of his throat when the older vigilante straightens).

And if Baby Bird’s breathing don’t *hitch* when he does it? Well, Jay ain’t gonna tell *nobody*. (Til the time is *right*.) But he sure as *shit* can grin like a nasty bastard at Timmy’s slightly pink face.

Looking over his shoulder because *I am just seeing what I want to see* is something he needs to prove to himself. After that—that *thing* in the bathroom (*not going to think about it—fuck, I ****am**** thinking about it*), he’s pretty much on-board with biological imperative...until Jason Todd’s eyes go dark, a very *different* kind of dark.

“Jesus *fuck*, Timmy,” and the low, dangerous growl makes his eyes get *wide* because that isn’t the usual ‘Red Hood’ voice—it’s something more *feral*, something that makes incredibly *different* things come to mind (you know, messy sheets, crying and begging, gripping anything possible because—*whoa, being this pathetic is starting to get *irritating).

“What did I—?” But his throat is dry for some reason, unable to finish.

“If’n ya’d just a’ *told* us, we coulda been—” is Jason’s dark eyes, is a step back toward the chair, those big hands still glove-free and calloused, used to holding guns and knives, hands that rubbed circles between his shoulder blades when he was nothing less than *utterly fucking pathetic*.

And for a *second*, for just a *second*, he thinks Jason might be coming at him to pull him from the chair, tilt his face up by a hold on his jaw, and lean down enough to—

“I *despise* your re-directs, Drake!”

Breaks the moment, makes both of them take a *breath* because if he really thought Jason would do *that* when he has a whole lot of handsome vigilante dating Dick *anyway*, then he really is getting desperate *as well as* pathetic. Which is just *really* not his style.

He swallows a little, but a slight laugh takes the tension out of his shoulders as he shoves himself up to meet the little Demon starting to make his way down the winding staircase from the Manor proper.

He smirks up at Jason’s still smouldering eyes, grips a shoulder and squeezes because just *ha-ha, asshole, good one*.

“Nice one, Jay. Almost had me for like *two seconds*,” before he moves away to the big computer, still smirking and ignoring the *hell* out of the uncomfortable clench in his chest, just laughs it off anyway.

Where he can’t see, can’t *look*, Jason’s eyes narrow dangerously, mouth taunt. It’s going to take some doin’ on their part to convince Timmy it ain’t all justa fucking *laugh*. “Almost had ya’?” He tisks under his breath, “Baby Bird, we’re *gonna *have ya’, jus’ don’t know it yet.”

And if he feels the heat of Jason’s eyes when he starts looking at the data on the big computer and Dami huffs up at him like a sulking, wet cat, well, he’ll believe it’s just because he finally gets *the* *joke*.

\*\*

Raven, however, is never, *never* caught unawares.

Until she sees the expression on Tim and Jason’s faces in that incredibly crucial moment. She had managed to turn just enough, opened her mouth the say *something* about the subroutine Tim was trying to use to trace the Insidious Seven (but the signal is simply not…it is not *possible*) from the gauntlet—

When she realizes Jason’s eyes are half-mast, and the twist of his lips is very far away from his usual humor and sarcasm (when she *realizes* the look on his face is one given to Kory and Roy once upon a time and currently reserved for Dick Grayson). And Tim… his cheeks are very, *very* pink, and before her eyes, the man behind Red Robin bites down on his lower lip hard enough to puncture while the small motion on the screen is obviously him shuddering.

And—

Her mouth *drops open*.

Before Cassie realizes Raven is *staring*, before the two men in the Cave realizes she has *seen* them as such, Raven turns hastily and reviews the rhythmically fading words on the screen in front of her, the blinking *search in progress…* does nothing to stop the heat from suffering her face and the very *small* smirk of satisfaction regardless of some second-hand embarrassment.

When the elevator doors open for Gar and Bart, she is the first to gain everyone’s attention with a trail that may lead to the location of the Insidious Seven, drawing them away from the Bats on screen.

\*\*

And it’s his side’a da’ city, ya *get that, asswipe?* On ‘dis side o’ the street, anyone who’s anyone knows ya come ta ole Matches when ya’s dealing ‘n *information*.

He likes keepin’ it on the ‘low, just a few stoolies and squealers what keep an ear ta the ground, see?

S’ when he just *happens* ta puta word *out*, he knows it’s gunna *go* places. Maybe somebody oughta know some terrorist fucks hidin’ in Gotham, fencing kids n’ shit. Dunn’t matter whatcha need n’ dis dirt-ball ‘burg, ain’t *no body* gunna look da other way wid’ kiddies fa sale.

He might throw some names, might give a low-down. Might haveta wait a minute for sumthin’ back.

In the meantime, the alter ego is kneeling low on the roof of the old sardine factory, staring down from one of the dirty skyline windows. Sharp eyes see the two tied-up captives against one dilapidated wall (ten guards, heavily armed, ill-fitting clothing, a few tech tools on a beaten-up table along the far wall—not a permanent hideout, just somewhere to stash “the goods”). One is Dick playing unconscious police man, and the other must be Shaw, still in prison orange with cuffs on his wrists and ankles.

The guard glancing at them every now and then isn’t attentive enough, and B lifts Matches’ shirt up enough to get the modified air gun, fitting in a tracer/comm. The window pane comes up enough to send a sharp slice of light across Dick’s closed eyes (*isn’t this familiar? He’s not in the boots anymore, Bruce.)* to give the signal to his first Robin.

The minute shift of shoulder, a flicker of fingers.

That’s what he needs to know.

Dick isn’t freeing himself and taking them out because he doesn’t have what he needs yet. Or he’s walked into something he wants to explore further.

Still, B aims carefully over the rim of Matches’ dark shades. The air gun is virtually silent and powerful, firing the comm a foot or so above Dick’s elbows.

His ward cracks an eye to train on the guards crowded around the laptop (Tim would be very angry at that piece of crap) and talking too low to be heard, then makes sure Shaw is looking away before he slips the zip tie and picks the comm out without moving more the his arm, and fits the device in his ear, slips his hand back in the tie.

Since Dick is laying on his stomach, it’s easy to turn his face enough to hide his lips moving while he talk-whispers, “onto something. Good to go.”

“What are they going to do with you?” B counters softly.

“Not sure. Don’t think they planned it. I just joined the transport.”

Okay, this isn’t forethought. Good to know they didn’t try to kill him instead—they might have blown Nightwing’s cover.

“You’re not part of the plan, so you could be a problem they’re waiting to solve.” Is B’s sage advice while loading the air gun with a different cartridge.

“Gave ‘em a reason to keep me around.”

B fires into a crack coming down the opposing wall, far enough from the group of disguised kidnappers, already loading another camera to place. One, however, breaks off from the group, approaching the man still in a prison jumpsuit. He’s pulled to his feet and shuffled, still shackled, to the vacated chair and his handcuffs unlocked.

“Criminals don’t usually appreciate your sparkling personality, Dick,” B observes dryly, listening to the almost-silent snort across the comm. “Is Shaw in on the prison break or not?”

And there’s *the detective* in him: never assume, always expect the unexpected (just a rule of thumb when one dresses like *a bat* to fight dangerous and usually mentally unstable criminals).

“Guy was coerced,” is Dick’s breathed reply, “need you to go find his family.”

B hums, the request filling in the blanks, laying the air gun by his knee, pulling his sleek phone from the pocket of Matches’ awful suit. He needs a better vantage, and uses his phone to point and zoom the camera. There’s no way to tell what’s on the laptop screen the prisoner is now furiously typing away at, but he can certainly bet his favorite utility belt it has something to do with a technical company that just *happened* to have his family name it the title (*why else take the prisoner with the most success infiltrating their system?*)

Bruce pauses at that, already activating the equipment to feed directly into the Cave. “I don’t like leaving you here.”

“Pfft.”

“You can’t be Nightwing and Officer Grayson this time,GCPD has already found the abandoned transport.” Thus, the *where’s Dick Grayson* card would be pulled—one of the unfortunate setbacks to his son’s day job. It’s a good thing they had people to help them stay ahead of the game, B thinks absently, linking the feed into O’s systems, opening the comm line in case she might be recording. (The second she comes back online, she’ll have sightings, feeds of him thrown in the van for the police techs to “stumble upon” Jim...might have a point about his people, like Bullock, getting lazy. Ironically, his own daughter is the worst offender, not that the guy in the cape really needs to inform Commissioner Gordon of this anyway).

“No suit under the uniform,” answers B’s observation. Combined with O’s evidence, Officer Grayson is going to come out of this with an insane amount of luck and good backstory. Fielding the questions like a pro (because hiding a secret identity from an entire *police squad*? Charm and talent—both of which Dick has in spades).

*But*. It’s always good to have a contingency.”I’m leaving a suit up here under the lip of the skyline.”

“M’ good, Bruce. I need to know his family is safe before I can move on them.”

*Dammit, Dick*. If anyone *knows* all of B’s tells (other than Alfred, Clark, and Diana—and all three of them are iffy at any given time), it’s his first Robin. This is the kid that jumped out of an a burning helicopter in his first three months after he earned the tunic. He made several jokes about giving B a *Bat-attack*, laughing with his suit still smouldering and probably several pulled muscles from finally catching himself on the side of Wayne Tower.

B didn’t kill him then, but it had been a *stretch*.

He sighs hard through the comm, makes sure Dick can *hear it*. All those lectures will pay off one day. “All right, I’ll find them,” the World’s Greatest Detective allows while frowning, watching Dick breathe and John Shaw concentrate. A muscle in his jaw jumps, “no matter what, don’t let them take you out of the city.”

He doesn’t need to see to know Dick is smirking, “like that’s going to happen a second time, boss. Go. I need Batman on this.”

If he gets beat up too badly, B has every intention of siccing Alfred on him, and that gives him what he needs to back away, the vigilante moving in the skin of Matches Malone—he’s down the side of the building, taking in the two vans sitting in the loading bay. It takes him no amount of time to plant what he needs inside and out, searching each vehicle for the usual clues. The comm is still in his ear as he’s walking down the trashy alleyway, long, brisk strides turn into an easy, slouching walk. The air gun is in the back of his pants, looking every part of *real* but with pellets that are going to sting long enough to keep someone occupied.

He expects O’s wave, subtly checks the time, and then fills her in on the spread of networks they’re knee-deep in at the moment.

“I take a *nap* for *Four. Hours*. and—”

“I know,” he grumbles around the matchstick in the side of his mouth.

“*I’m *not the one with sidekicks, you know—”

“Mmhm,” B hums and pauses, taking a second to lift his chin at the dirtbag likewise slouching his way. There’s a fifty in the palm of his hand when they shake in passing, the dirtbag giving a quick, timid nod—* shipment coming in tomorrow night still solid*—before he’s scuttling away.

“—I’m going to Kick. His. *Ass*.”

“We have a complicated case, Babs. I need him functional.” Is a mild observation.

“Oh, believe me, when I get through with *him*—”

“He has it handled,” as he finally comes to the Monte Carlo parked right on the cross-section of Kryssing and Grummet— the perfect place to be seen by the right kind of people. “Calm down. Tell me anything about this situation is a *surprise*.”

“Wait until I talk to Tim, then we’ll see how much of a mess we’ve really gotten into.”

“It’s all related,” his fingers ride up the sleek hood as he puts the partial pieces together, “I mean *all* of it. A terrorist organization dealing in specialized weapons and human cargo, a new crew of villains using the same kind of altering tech? Shaw’s prison break? The tracking system tracers from Wayne Enterprises? The littles? *All* of it, Barbara”

At her place below the theatre, she takes a minute to breathe in the implications “...has he confirmed, boss?”

B raises a brow while he pilots the car out of the warehouse district. His distinct lack of answer makes the soft sound of Barbara facepalming that much more *obvious*—she usually saves that kind of thing for Stephanie, but, with circumstances being what they *are*, it’s warranted.

“I suppose a vacation is out then?”

The smile lights up Matches’ face and he guffaws, “you like the juicy ones just as much as the rest of us.”

“I do,” she admits shamelessly, cracking her knuckles and chugging the last bit of warm coffee, cracks her neck on both sides, rolls her shoulders. *Ah, time to get ****to work***.

“You also like getting revenge when possible.”

“Oh, you *know*, I do.” Now there’s a series of commands, Oracle warming up with something like hacking into the traffic cam grid.

“And you’ll have a reason to ask Felicity to visit Gotham.”

Oracle doesn’t *squeal*, but it certainly *sounds* like she did. “*Yes*, there is *nothing* like a Girl’s Day after the end of a satisfying case.”

B hums a little, starting to speed up as he comes out of Gotham proper, checking the live feed on his phone to see Dick now propped up against the wall, the bindings on his ankles cut, the bag brought up over his head enough to let him drink an offered bottle of water.

The carrot he’d dangled in front of these guys is enough to get him water, at least.

“You haven’t had a mani-pedi in too long, sweetheart,” he drawls out in his best Brucie Wayne, making her laugh while she works.

“I’m a busy lady. Certain people keep me neck-deep in *bad guys*,” and *yes*, she’s smirking, Bruce. “You get back to the Cave and let me know what you find out on the Shaw family. I’ll take it from there. I’m already into his recorder and cam. We’ll convene an hour before time to fly.”

“Sounds good. Talk to you then,” and he taps the comm off, Wayne Manor visible over the rolling hills. His mind works furiously, plotting the way tonight is going to go, how the next succession of days is going to go, and who he intends to call in. He has a plan for the littles, to keep them *out* of anything linked to Genesis or those bastards that hurt them. He has a plan to keep Tim in their sights. He has a plan for who he is 99.9% positive are the residuals of the White Triad that kidnapped and tortured one of his son and currently has a hold of another. He has a plan for the labs and weapons designers using *people* to create soldiers with the capability of mass destruction.

All he needs is whatever criminal mastermind is pulling all the strings. And that? Is just a matter of *time*.

\*\*

“They have recalibrated it,” Dami uses two fingers to widen the image of the WE tech implanted in the gauntlet, then holds his phone screen out for Tim and Jason to tilt their heads slightly to the right in thought.

“They messed with the trackers,” and Tim’s eyes go from the original design specs dug from the old server back to the scans taken in Titan’s Tower less than an hour ago. Well, it’s not like he really *needs* to see the old schematics. Some things just kind of *stay* with you, right?.

“They have made it suitable for their needs,” the fifth Robin corrects and lays his phone down on the Batcomputer’s console, typing a few commands, he zooms the image to the corresponding location. “It functions as a tracking device as you originally intended. However, added circuitry and a small motherboard here,” and the image moves further down the new scan, “will allow it omit a burst—”

“EMP,” Jason fills in, arms crossed over his chest, beating Tim to it because the younger vigilante is deep in his own thoughts, “so’s they can kill the tech what when someone maybe starts havin’ a little strike of free will or some shit.”

“It’s smart if they don’t want the configurations at risk should anyone get the prosthetic off one of their people. If the thing hadn’t been damaged in the fight, it probably would have activated anyway and taken down our plane.” And even with, you know, *fliers* on team, he’s not a fan of how *that* scenario could have panned out for them. Just *really*. He hates to be impressed by bad guy tech, *hates it*, but at this juncture, he has to admit the new design is really pretty bad ass.

While the detectives go over the files Dami brought to the table and Alfred arranges for dinner *upstairs*, Sirs, the purr of the returning Monte Carlo is enough for all three to tense, to move out of the other’s peripherals just in case, well, *fight time*.

B, however, stands up in the niche between the open door and car, sunglasses sliding down his nose so his eyes can be *that blue*. He sees it, the way the three of them (*all three of them*) automatically add the others to the count—how they look very much like a *team*. He puts the observation on the backburner, adding it to the mental tally of *items to prove Tim is back*.

“Sarry, fellas, looks like we gotta change a’ *plans*,” followed by a slick grin and Matches’ wink.

\*\*

And it’s…*odd*. Suiting up in the Cave right at sundown again is just like waking up to realize his bedroom is still just that. It’s bittersweet, past and present in a crazy kind of convergence in his brain pan. His locker hasn’t changed; the shitty hair crap he used to use (because spikey was just the *so cool* at the time—*nerd*) in his first few years in the R is oddly still there. New can of it along with other sundries, things he thought he’d left *behind* to end up in the trash.

Dressing from the locker three spaces from the end, those unshakeable blue eyes are dark with that same innate knowledge Jason had of how crazy this all is for him.

He swallows lightly staring without moving. “I...it’s still…” But his throat is tighter, enough that more words get stuck, don’t make it out.

B, however, just grins a little sadly and nods, “yup. Still yours.”

And if his fingers hesitate away from the roll of white binding tape, no one would even see it, but he can tell it’s the thinner, more flexible stuff he personally prefers. Glancing further back and *yup*, new additions because there’s a bottle of antibiotics sitting in the center, an obvious *don’t forget me if you feel like ass*.

The man getting ready beside him is moving further and further into the Batman, even if the cowl is the last thing to top off the evening wear, but even still, he hears the soft burr that is all Bruce—

“Tim? You okay?”

And he glances over to see most the Batsuit on and ready, sees B in mid-reach, the hand on his shoulder gloved and gauntleted, familiar, gripping and grounding.

Shit, how long had he been standing here *staring at the inside of his old locker?*

Long enough for the World’s Greatest Detective to take *note*. Well, shit.

“Good. I’m...good,” and yeah, he means it surprisingly. He really fucking *does*.

Like he *gets* something, B smile changes to the one when he’s genuinely pleased, and the hand squeezes again. “After we pull a rescue of another self-sacrificing son of mine, we’ll get you back to your Perch for your own tools if you’re workstation is missing something.”

Tim finally starts with wrapping his hands and ankles with the usual precise movements to work himself into the coming night, into what he would need to *be* in the next hour (*something Robin couldn’t be*). “It’s...pretty well stocked,” he replies carefully because if he *mentions* something, then it’s going to appear there next time and *just*— (yeah, he thought it: *next time*). “My isolated systems, however, yeah. Yeah, I’ll need to access it.”

B is stocking the hidden pockets in his suit, fitting the *last ditch* contingencies in his gauntlets as well as the hidden spots in the small of his back, over the side of his ribs, and on the sides of both thighs. “You can connect the set-up directly to your laptop here.”

*Your laptop*.

“Yeah. A few config changes from the Perch should do it,” he replies softly, something in his chest on this crazy edge of *breakable*. He keeps half-turned away just on fucking *principle* while he wraps his hands six and one half times from palm to wrist, ankles and heels the same. The familiar motions are soothing, getting him where he needs to be, giving him some kind of grounding when it’s possible he might just hit the streets running and conveniently *fail* to look back.

(But...it’s a little *too late* for that isn’t it? He’s got plans from here on out, how to find the threat the *contain* it, but not-not how to get himself back *out* of Gotham.)

“Good. That will make it easier to coordinate. We’ve got more irons in the fire than I initially intended.”

“Sucks when a piece of it has to do with the secret ident.” He deadpans, “It’s not good publicity for your company, you know.”

“*Our* company,” Bruce corrects, fitting on his utility belt while blatantly looking over at his third Robin (*and those moments are right in his peripheral—a shorter, younger, more innocent version of this man in red, gold, and green. ****His**** Robin*), “and it’s fine. My CEO is going to find out all the particulars since he’s only *slightly* annoyed when bad guys use his tech.”3

Yup, now he’s *laughing like an asshole*. That’s B for you, playing the *troll* when things are getting heavy and tight.

Between the bench and his locker, he’s stretching, slower and more precise because residual *owfuck*, making his hips get with the program. The discreet check of the bandage is clean before the armored tunic, gauntlet and gloves, running a check of the computer. Down to socks and boots, then the more necessary hardware.

His fingers catch all the seams, all the padding, looking for the inevitable tracers since, you know, whatever design that might have come from the Titans should have an *epic* array.

Bruce is just standing there easy and patient, waiting for him to get on with it because he already *knows* Tim’s rituals. And it’s good to know some things don’t *change*.

And it’s a moment, a clear thing that makes him ache in all the *best* ways because he’s grinning, remembering when they were in these same spaces, talking about cases and crazy bad guys between *how was the history test?* *Is Ariana going with you to the movies tomorrow night?*

It’s just—

It’s the same way he felt...you know, as the *other* Robin. All of it, past and present existing in this space, between lockers, getting ready to take and deliver a beatdown with a little detecting on the way to the inevitable end. And it’s a moment, a scary, heady moment that Bruce was right *on*—

(*Welcome Home*)

And yeah, yeah. Good. Fucking. *Times*.

\*\*

“Something is *off*,” Leo says low once J’onn drops off Cuddle Bug with the other in their section of rooms in the Watchtower. “Something is *really* off.”

Caro hugs Carl the Unicorn and her eyes slide to the side of their communal area. The other littles grab random things, a book, a puzzle, a tablet, and the four migrate to the beanbags in one corner of the room (the corner furthest away from the security cameras—they could have gone to into one of the bedrooms that didn’t *have* anything, but none of them wanted to seem suspicious, not when Caro can create a neural network anyway).

While it seemed like they were doing things on the outside, Caro holds up her book with Carl in her lap, and starts weaving their minds together into a bridge.

Karmen sniffs, starting the 1,000 piece puzzle of the Louvre, *“all right. Clark talked to Bart, Barry, and Wally before we left.”*

*“Miguel looked sick when Diana came for us,”* Charlie confirms.

*“J’onn blocked me so I wouldn’t get it from his mind.” *Caro tilts her head a little as the nursery rhyme goes through her conscious thoughts so if J’onn was listening, he would initially think she was just reading.

*“I don’t like this,”* Charlie sighs a little, tablet in his hands starting to flicker, the coding flashes black and white binary for a second. *“I’m going to see if I can find something*.”

*“Good. Don’t let them trace you*,” Karmen agreed. *“I’m going to let them get further away and then I’m going to go to the secondary control room*.” The annoyed tinge to his thoughts comes through on the bridge, the others raising brows at him.

*“Good idea,”* Leo replies, pulling out his samples to compare with the big book Mr. Batman gave him. *“We need to know what we’re up against*.*”*

*“They don’t ****mean**** anything by it*,*”* Caro defends, *“they just want us to be safe.”*

*“They want us to be in the dark,”* Leo sighs, still annoyed.

*“Leave ‘em alone,”* Charlie snipes back, *“you know what Mr. Batman said.”*

Karmen clears her throat, *loudly*. *“We’re not going to fight with each other. We need to agree on what we’re going to do. We’re a ****team****, remember? We need to act like it.”*

Leo and Charlie straighten up just like Karmen intended. And they’ll help get a decoy so she can sneak into the control room and use Red’s disruptor (that she might have, maybe, picked up the last time they were at the Tower. *Sorry, Red*) to access the JL’s database and find out why the alerts.

Caro, however, visibly twitches, her head turns just slightly. Unconsciously, she holds Carl the Unicorn just *that much* tighter.

*“What is it, Cuddles?”* Leo asks, eyes moving around the room. His hand under the back cover of the book, shifts just slightly, fingernails becoming sharp claws in case they needed to defend themselves.

*“I just…”* her thoughts trail off, her eyes distant, *“I thought I felt someone. we used to know*.*”*

The kids exchange a glance, pass it off as a fluke of her powers. No one they knew from Genesis survived. *No one but them*.

The smallest just lays her cheek on Carl’s fluffy flank and shakes her head at them, and they go back to their seemingly busy activities, Charlie’s thoughts a background noise on the bridge as he scans the current message board coded for the JL members on world—a way for the mass of bodies ready for the next wave of supervillains could easily communicate with the space station. He goes through the next set of channels when nothing leaps out (Karmen’s jolt makes him pause when he sees Barry is on one of the “projects” in testing, but she promises to fill them in later).

He sighs and pulls up the Titan’s Tower mainframe in a smaller screen, already working carefully to get around Red’s security. If he hadn’t been introduced to the system by the admin himself, the cyber smack-down would be sever enough to fry whatever device he’s using—luckily, Charlie learned from him *and* Vic.

*Charlie*.

Leo is looking at him, making an eyes dance to the cameras.

*Oh. Sorry*, he blinks and settles into the Watchtower security of their room (and there’s still so many places he can’t *get to* here, but if his time in Genesis taught him anything, it’s to always try and control the room he’s in—no matter *what*). He breathes out slowly, having to pull out of the Titans system so he could concentrate enough to—

*Four*.

Karmen’s body tenses.

*Three.*

Leo gingerly places another sample from the Grand Canyon.

*Two*

Caro releases her death grip on Carl.

*One.*

And he loops the feed long enough for the four to leap out of their beanbags, grabbing one of the child-sized dolls in the corner, propping it up with blankets, filling it out, facing away from the camera. Caro puts pigtails in the same way as Karm wears, Leo placing the hands on puzzle pieces, Karmen throwing her t-shirt off, giving it to Charlie to put on the doll. She can change better with just the tank-top underneath, and is already shifting her skin pigment, becoming the color of the bland walls.

Sweating with the strain, Charlie gasps and the children scatter back to their positions as the vent cover is removed and Karmen starts through.

When J’onn switches screens to check on the children, realizing it had been over an hour since they’d all been brought to the Watchtower, he relaxes when he sees them all safe in their communal area watching *Moana* on the big screen.

He will check on them after he assigns the newest batch of intel from the Titans, lab records he believes, and perhaps offer to make them the popcorn which, as he has been educated on by Kara *more than once*, is usually an appealing snack of movies.

J’onn checks the time again. He has another hour before Shazam is sent to relieve him, and a movie sounds quite appealing.

\*\*

The language is Kurdish, and Officer Grayson is now *intrigued*. They didn’t have to say his name, but the description: “Tall, dark-haired Romani.”

That’s all him. And *apparently*, they’re going to take him somewhere out of Gotham. They have transportation waiting, so not going to kill him (which is nice for once). But, he’s going to get a first-class ticket to their super bad guy hideout without really *trying *that hard, so *bonus*. He’s going to call this a winning scenario. The muffled argument seemed to be a fifty-fifty there for a while, the person on the other end of the line insisting they didn’t need any *more* hostage, and the guys with him in the here and now point out how having someone associated with the name *Wayne* would make it easier to get what they need should Shaw be unable to *perform*.

“Inigo, I’m going to need to use the john eventually.” He says conversationally, hoping to get a little closer to the conversation.

“Not getting your hands free, understand?”

“Oh? I’m *flattered*, really, but usually *ladies* offer to hold it for me while I—”

“I’m warning you to shut it, Grayson, unless you want to be shot by your own piece” A hand on his elbow gets him to his feet. He pretends to weave, off-balance because of the bag over his face, tries to make it seem like his orientation is off.

But, the weaving gets him in the right position to activate the comm in his pocket while he’s lead to the bathroom, catching more of the conversation, times and places for *something*, and if he’s smiling under the bag, well, the bad guys would never know it’s because of how *easy* it is to rope them into doing just what you want. Delivering them into the hands of cops and vigilantes is really going to make his *day*.

\*\*

With the whiteouts up, Red is staring at a house on the outskirts, close to the middle of nowhere in the span of distance between Gotham and New York City. As far as hideouts go, it’s not a bad location, close enough to be within communication limits, far enough out that no one is going to come *looking*.

On the other half of the screen, the security footage from the warehouse plays in real time, Dick and Shaw in their places along the far wall while the baddies are scrambling to pack-up the temp hideout. They needed to get moving and *now*.

With the Titans on their end of the *find the bad guys and/or dangerous tech*, he’s good to go with the Bats. In the forty-five minutes since she joined the land of the *living*, O is apparently running *full speed ahead*, coordinating with his people as well as the routes the Bats intend to take tonight. She’s confirmed the littles made it to the Watchtower, the Insidious Seven must be recouping underground since the last fight did a *right* amount of *damage*, and she’s single-handedly doling out assignments with the intel he opened up in the Batplane’s home drive. Not to *mention*, she might have dropped a little hint, hint in Commissioner Gordon’s email because *you know*, there’s a manhunt going on for everyone’s favorite boy in blue.

Everything coming together because *damn* she’s good.

His wrist computer is set to ping with the necessary updates for his side projects, all steadily working, falling into *place*, and his head is *tight* for the game. (*Not going to think about it.*)

“I got the location from a mobile I pinged at N’s location” O is saying over the line, “Google Earth is a wonderful thing when I’ve got no other live feeds.”

With Jason right behind him, looking up at the big screen, eyes narrowed behind the domino, Tim has a sudden *awareness* of how close they are, how close Jason’s hand could be to his hip if—

*Fuck. ****Focus***. *Just a joke*.

“We’re going to have to do this in one move,” he finds himself saying to keep his thoughts on the mission.

B hums, the only thing left is to put on the cowl, and *BOOM*, Batman. “True. If they realize we’re onto them, they might kill the hostages.”

“Easy,” Jason draws out, “B goes after the goods. We getcha word s’all copesthetic, then me, Timmy, n’ Demon take a little *time* with Big Wing’s new *friends*, yeah?”

Dami tuts, adjusting his hood over his head, eyes dark behind the whiteouts. “For once, Todd, I believe your plan has merit.”

Jay has no problems pointing a gloved finger right *at* that little motherfucker, “don’t start bitchin’, Baby Bat. I always getcha outta whatever *situation* y’ might fall inta.”

Behind the dom, Dami is arching an eyebrow, “as you are so *fond* of saying—*ditto*. I am not without my own *talents*.”

The smirk cuts across both their features even if Jason guffaws back at him, “aw now, yer just still *pissed* y’ didn’t get the takedown on Mask last time.”

“I *earned* the finishing blow, Todd,” Dami snarls with his nose in the air, “I was the one who found him in the first place. The situation was under control. You, however, simply *showed up.*”

Jason gives *no shits* about shoving the hood back to rub his knuckles in the top of Damian’s skull, “mmhm. Didn’t even send an *invite*, you little shit. What’s fiddy or so baddies ‘tween *friends*?”

The duck-and-spin is becoming habit because for *some* reason, Todd foolishly shows his *affection* in this manner. It does not, however, warrant a knife in his kidneys as that would probably anger his father and earn him, at the very least a grounding.

Instead, Dami doesn’t miss a beat. “A well-spent evening, of course.”

And *yup*, Tim snickers, looking at the two over his shoulder while B shakes his head a little, looking over the map (don’t think no one sees you *smiling*).

“Be nice to your brother,” B decides to add off-handedly as he leans down to send a message to the Watchtower about the Titan’s newest threat, “it’s nice to have allies in our line of work.”

Dami and Jason exchange a look because it’s time to divert B from starting into a *lecture*. The helmet goes on, and Tim fits on—strangely enough—a domino. The cape isn’t the usual pizo-electrice he uses when he not in a cowl, but it’s slightly heavier than the normal, only enough to notice without throwing him off his game. It’s good for him, flows in just the right way (*dom and cape combo like when he was—*still kind of *is*— kind of* that Robin*).

They move as the message is sent and the cowl goes on. The big car rotates when they walk across it, adjusting automatically, to the platform with Ducatis Alfred prepped a few hours ago. Comms are tapped, synced, legs are thrown over seat, minute adjustments made, last-minute life-savers stored in side pockets and in spans of reinforced armor. The big car starts, the deep rumble under their boots (a variable reminder of *the day is saved*), and it’s just the start they’re all waiting for.

Hood, Red, and Robin look up, ease back on the bikes and helmet *up*. When B gives them one last look before he slips down into the driver’s seat of the Batmobile, one last silent *be careful*, it’s an understanding that they are going to have a *good fucking night*.

\*\*

The boys follow him through the darkness, staying in a tight formation until they hit a mile out of Gotham. He sees them break-off at the pre-determined section of town, coming from different angles for anything *else* going down in the city tonight.

The police scanner is playing in the background, Jim’s voice barking out orders as the undercover vehicles are starting to mobilize. Batman ss going to reach the scene *first*, take down the kidnappers, question them within an *inch* of their lives, and leave them tied up for the police. He’s going to make sure the hostages haven’t been harmed before he teaches their tormentors why criminals in Gotham City *fear the night*.

Once he gives the signal, the boys are going for the next piece of the puzzle and get them a *hell* of a lot more clues to tie everything together.

It’s B’s intuition leading him to see the strands of connections, the evidence starting to add up to a much bigger picture, one possibly crossing Barry, Wally, and Bart’s pending problem. The moment the analysis from Titans’ Tower indicating the gauntlet could use gravity for transportation, something inevitably *clicked*. J’onn would make sure the designs are sent to Barry and see if the disturbances they’ve been coming across could be caused by *this* technology (he’s betting his utility belt on something from Earth—and no way is Hal going to *collect*).

His usual back-alleys and side roads are cleared without compromising speed (*ETA ten*) with the car’s complex system and O’s directions in his ear. The screen in the dash is showing Dick and Shaw being brought to their feet, being moved, obscured by massive, black duffles, and the glint of available semi-automatics. The trackers in the boys’ Ducatis tell him they’re already on scene and ready to move.

He switches feeds to the map as he gets out of the city proper and on the span of open highway, he shifts to the higher gear, and brings out the *speed*.

\*\*

“*Baby Bird.*” Is Hood over comms while the two of them ride side-by-side after watching Dick and Shaw already being loaded into separate vans and a third vehicle pull away with a squeal of tires and air of *something crucial*. The quick hack into their cell line (thanks for lookin’ out, O) is just exactly *worst case scenario*. They’re taking Shaw further into Gotham, another hideout, and Dick...is on his way to Dixon Docks until “the ship” comes in (and *yes*, he sees the helmet automatically swing his way, a gloved hand on his wrist before he can jerk away because the *asshole knows* what kind of things still grate on his nerves). The last wonderful addition to the plan is whatever *sazî* could be (*“device”? Can we be a little *more* vague, please?*)

“I *know*.” Because he and Hood and Rob are on the same page, and *that shit?* Not. Happening. They’re not getting Dick out of Gotham, they’re not killing the guy’s family, and they’re as *shit* not getting away. He hits the accelerator, talking calmly through the comm in his helmet because, *welp*, he’s *that guy*, isn’t he? “We’re going to have to split up. Rob is on Shaw, B stays with the family, Hood is on whatever they’re transporting, and I’m going after Dick.”

The static clears up once they hit more open road. “Don’ like it, Red. Gettin’ stretched thin here.”

“Already got a plan for it,” he manages over the comm in his bike helmet. He hits the Ducati to take it up another five...ten...fifteen. “Besides, like I can’t handle a few terrorist asshats, Hood? I’m fucking *insulted* over here.”

“Don’t be an *asshole*, Red. He’s only got two with ‘im, but watch’ya ass anyhow, you feel me?”

“Shaw is still en route.” is the youngest vigilante’s low growl, apparently *unimpressed* by the plan. “The tracker is functional, there is no reason I cannot—”

“They might peg him as a liability, Rob,” Red tries to be sensible about it all, “could take him out once they get wind we’re on to them. We can’t chance it.”

“Goddammit, Red, you’d better not get *more* chewed up, *do you mother-****fucking**** feel me*?”

“I love you too, Hood. Now, we’re going to follow the bad guys, get our vigilante back, and stomp them for using innocent people in the first place. A nice little revenge while we figure out who the *hell* used our kids for this shit, and *then* we get to beat some *more* ass. Everyone on point?”

“Fucking *righteous*.”

“Understood.”

“Good. We’ll hit back on comms in thirty.” He doesn’t pause, doesn’t look over at Hood’s taller figure on the bike next to him; he veers off the back path and hits the main street of Gotham, already following the second van with Dick in the back.

From the mini-LED screen on the upper right of his visor, he watches the blips (Hood, Rob, B) moving to their separate locations, and even if they’re in hot pursuit, all systems *Go*, the anticipation of a good knock-down-drag-out, one that *might* have some certain asshats that held him in a goddamned ship for almost two weeks, rises up to override the pain from the injuries. At this moment, nothing short of his own funeral is going to keep him from the fight and possible rescue (*hold on, Dick, just ****hold the fuck on****, they’re not getting you out of the city. I’m not going to let that happen*).

And as far as his luck goes, the truck is not nearly as heavily armored as inmate transport, but is more bulky and boxy (their attempt at flying below the radar-seriously, terrible bad guy calls) giving him more room to hide so the driver doesn’t catch anything other than the normal road noise when they take the big bridge connecting main Gotham to the east side (and going toward the docks, just like the last time—). He needs more room, less people around to take the vehicle out once B gives the signal (because they weren’t getting Dick that far, *that shit isn’t going down*).

The comm is still going in his ear, Hood biting out he’s got the surprise secondary transport in sight heading North, probably going to take the highway to get to New York City if there’s merchandise to deliver. B is in the final questioning stage of *who do you work for* after a very nice demonstration of *the Motherfucking Batman* in all his ass-kicking glory (and B usually *does* get a little more violent if innocent *kids* are involved). He reports he was smart in putting a fidget spinner and Magic Markers in his utility belt because Jenny seems to be enjoying herself with making evil mustaches on the tied-up kidnappers. B kindly looked away when Mary seemed intent on kicking the utter crap out of the remaining four. Rob’s breath hitches and he’s on the move as well, following the third vehicle to track wherever these asshats are taking Shaw.

And even with the mass of utter *fuckery* going down right now, he’s completely focused, completely in control of himself and his emotions; he’s one *hundred percent* in the *game*.

“We’re good. GCPD is almost here,” is B’s deep darkness over the line, “take them *down*.”

A flick of the hand and a whirlybird is in hand, ready to skim lightly across the ground between him and the transport, ready to affix itself to the undercarriage. It would activate in under a minute, the mini-EMP taking out the engine without a hitch. He shoves his helmet on the hook at the back-end as he sets the autopilot, thighs tensed and ready to jump, a whole lot of *hold on, Dick* in the forefront of his vigilante brain pan, and he *finally* is going to get the opportunity for some *real* payback.

\*\*

When the charge he missed in a hidden compartment of the van counts down to 0:00:00, Red is already trying to throw himself out and on top of Dick (because, you know, *armored tunic and shit*), but his load of *owfuck* hurts too much when Dick fights him in the little mid-air free fall away of the vehicle and twists them so Dick is on top to get any of the fiery consequences. He managed to get some scraps of paper and the GPS nav in the windshield before the nice *boop, boop, boop* caught a whole lot of attention. Ten seconds though was awful nice of them, right?

Red manages to get his left arm up and around to throw, at least, his cape around Dick’s back, his forearm blocking the back of Dick’s head in the case of like, *you know*, painful-fucking-debris.

It’s an unconscious thing, throwing the cape around the unarmored Officer, other arm around his back to grip and *hold*, pull the older man into his body for a better chance at protecting him from the fallout. He gives *no shits* about Dick pretty much laying on his abdomen while the big *boom* hits, fire flaring into the night, burning hard enough to reach the gas tank and another explosion follows right on the tail, sending flaming car parts to hit the ground around them and the two unconscious baddies Officer Grayson had already secured by the time he pulled the dying van over anyway. The bomb had taken them both by surprise, the two squawking “*trap!”* over comms in mid-leap. Dick is curled over him, a hand in his hair, shoving his face right into the vest.

It’s a good night when nothing *burning* lands on you. Just, really winning tonight.

The two of them give it a second before looking over at the calming enferno and visibly relaxing when nothing else is seems to ignite for yet *another* explosion.

“Thank *God*, Tim. Good catch,” just as more of Dick’s weight falls on him like his strings have been cut, and there’s a nose in his bare neck while his adrenaline is still *slightly* pumping, and so much of his attention narrows down to just *the puff of breath across his throat and Dick’s mouth is so ****close**** to that *spot* on his neck that makes him*—

Even with the night around them, even with things like *burning getaway vehicles*, and considering *what* their life consists of, it’s a crazy thing, a *telling* thing on how fucking *long* it’s been, when he makes a stupid, low *noise* in his throat, and his hips twitch just *slightly* up into Dick’s hip resting between his legs.

And the mortification?

*Is fucking real*

(This is all Jason’s fault— who’s he kidding? It’s Dick’s *too* dammit)

Because Dick freezes and he can *swear* he feels the brush of lashes when those eyes get wide (*I heard that Timmy—I ****heard**** that*), and he slowly, *slowly* raises himself up on his forearms, looks down at Red with his bare features half-lit in the smouldering light, and *just*—

(*How is this ****his life**** right now?*)

He starts *talking*, trying to play misdirect, “you okay? That was a pretty impressive explosion considering what an epic *piece of shit* those vans are. I mean, I only needed *one* whirlybird, Dick, so you know—”

“Timmy,” is low and deep, cuts him off completely because Dick’s hand moves to his jaw, thumb running along the line, “*Tim*.”

His chest stutters because *this is so wrong, too wrong*, and if Jay ever *found out*, if something ever slipped—

He might need to leave Gotham to finish this case up after all because the two of them are *fucking killing him*. Automatically, he licks his dry lips and in the scant light, he can still see Dick’s eyes go down to the motion, feels the pressure of the thumb on his jaw bare down.

“Seriously, are you okay? You don’t have armor,” but it’s really a desperate, last ditch attempt because he hasn’t pulled his arms away, is still *holding on*. Dick is still wrapped up in his damn *cape* even. His feet are just suddenly braced against the ground (ready to work his hips *up* again, right against—) and he hasn’t rolled the bigger man off, hasn’t tried to get up (because of how fucking *good* this feels).

Dick doesn’t answer, just tilts his face a little, just *enough*, and his forearms are lowering him down while Tim’s eyes go wide and his breath catches, his arms *tighten* because *Oh God, he’s going to...he’s really, really going to*—

Sirens split the night, closer than either of them even noticed, and both vigilantes jerk upright immediately.

“*Fuck*,” Dick spits out, kneeling over his thigh at a half-crouch, a very N move. “They have to find me.”

Red subtly pulls his legs up and is on his feet *fast* because making sure the bad guys are ready to be found without, you know, zip ties, and any clues in the wreckage to scavenge, any excuse to get the hell away from what that—*that*—almost was and—

He doesn’t even get his hips swiveled enough to turn around because Dick’s hand catches him by the wrist, and those *eyes* are bright enough in the night that something low in his abdomen clenches. He follows the move when Dick rises to his feet with his characteristic grace, smooth motion, looking up, breathless, his brain coming up with a whole lot of *nada* on how to even *handle* this right now.

“Don’t even *think* about running,” Dick pulls his wrist, making him stumble a step forward, catching himself with a hand on Dick’s shoulder, “we’re going to *talk*, and you aren’t going to duck away.” The underlying, *I come find you now* followed up by the very serious *and I will* is right there.

He blinks rapidly, wishing he’d put the whiteouts up again, “there’s...Dick, there’s nothing to talk about. I mean, that was one hell of an *adrenaline* rush. You know, kidnappings and near-death make people do— do crazy things, so we’re just going to write this off as a *holy shit* moment, okay? That’s—That’s—”

“There is no way you’re going to just—”

The approaching Ducati is hard to miss, beating the sirens by a slim margin, and Red grins, pulls away while Dick is rolling his eyes and sighing in frustration. But with time ticking down (*again*), they get with the program. He assures the Bats they’re okay over comms and makes sure Hood has the device with his baddies all nice and waiting for the GCPD to come for a pick-up. Rob is still following because *yes*, they need to get as close to the hideout as possible, and Red gets to the charred remains of the vehicle, swipes the random, surviving smartphone blown out of the car (it’s an Android, it’ll survive anything), mourning the melted laptop. Dick takes the zip ties off the two beaten-up bad guys and picks out where he’s going to be “found.”

Red is zip tieing him up as Hood pulls up and throws down the kickstand, he looks none the worse for wear after his own fight-and-snatch.

“Howz ‘bout it, boys?” A slight motion is Hood’s gloved finger against Dick’s neck, and Red takes a nice, subtle step *back*, pulling the cell from his cape pocket, looking *oh so busy* at the moment, *sorry*. Bad guys and such.

“It’s nice when they leave things for me to hack,” he shrugs a shoulder, ignores Dick on his knees (*Oh God, that image*), looking up at him with dark, *dark* eyes, and just turns slightly to the obviously approaching cops. “But, I digress, we need to get going.”

“S’ ‘bout time all good vigilantes get *ghost*,” and Hood hitches a thumb over his shoulder to the bike, “c’mon Red, give ya a ride, yeah?”

And *yes please*, get him the hell away from here, from this, and just—he needs to be working. Now. Right now.

“Aw, you should really consider joining Uber. Saving the day and all that,” he puts the cell phone he really wasn’t paying attention to anyway in his center compartment.

“Tim.”

And it’s an automatic gesture, a *mistake* to look down and see the very *different* smile cutting across Dick’s face while the older vigilante is down on his* *knees and zip tied at the wrists. (*That look!*)

“We’re going to do so much sleuthing when you get away from GCPD. It’s going to be great, really,” he rambles stupidly, *stupidly* breathless, and it just makes Dick’s smile get *darker* with something his brain refuses to process.

“*Timmy*,” cuts him off yet again, “Don’t. Run.”

Slowly, the helmet tilts up so Hood must be looking at him through the night as well. There’s going to be some...questions (*start working on a plan, Red)*.

“I have terrible bad guys to catch, remember?” He swallows, hands suddenly awkward enough that he lets the cape slide around to cover him. “But we’ll see you back at the Manor.”

“Yeah,” is modified with the synths, but there’s *something* off there, “don’t get snatched again, Dickie, you feel me? We got a *full plate* ta deal with as is.”

“And you’ll piss off Alfred. He saved you dinner,” he calls over his shoulder, gratefully already moving to the Ducati, giving the boyfriends a second to do their usual ‘*glad you’re okay, baby*’ kind of thing. Away from them both, he can get his head back in it, can pass off what he *thought* might be and realize he’s being a complete dumb ass about it all. Really, it’s Dick and Jay for fuck’s sake.

He works the bike, starts it up and slides back, turning on the tracker for his own a few miles back.

He’s not looking at Hood taking off the helmet long enough to say a few words and then (*Oh God, not looking, not looking. Shit! Totally looked*) fit their mouths together in something quick and still just—

He’s still looking at his wrist computer, trying to hide the fact his face is probably *on fire* while Hood swings a leg over the bike and it’s *get with the program time*.

The cool air is rushing when they spit gravel and take off, his cape flying behind him, hands gripping the seat right behind his ass instead of around Hood’s waist. He doesn’t look back at Dick, who they’re leaving behind, and when they get back to the Cave for the reconvene, he’s probably not going to be able to look at Jason in the face either.

My notes:

- This chappie: suiting up in the Cave edits, B comes back as Matches and they DO that bonding shit (Dick gets a bathroom break and sends a subtle message, ‘I’m good. Going to ride this out.’ He might also get more to connect the Triad so he and Jay can have the showdown they want with Tim)
- The Titans might find something in the tech that makes the capability change (the Architect’s power to Karmen’s, to Leo’s to Caro’s, maybe some DNA coding with genetic markers that look crazy hell familiar)
- The Gala mentioned: WIN
- This maybe? “This is totally unnecessary,” but it’s pretty damn nice anyway, and he fits the outer layer, hooking up that (*Jason’s*) harness, tightened to fit a little better and in working order.
-
- They’re going to divide and conquer; Bruce Wayne going to WE and digging into their little *problem* (a task B had tried to pawn off on him because of things like *owfuck* and bullet holes—but *nope*, not even. He and B? They made a *deal*). He and Hood are on the trail of certain bad guys with their hostage police officer, along with a certain eldest Robin along for the *ride*. Dami is going to coordinate them and the Titans while Kon and KF monitor for the Insidious Seven following the partial trace before it powered down. Gar and Raven are going through data respectively, and since, well, *connections,* they’ve got a few people in the JLA breaking down data as well (only a few labs’ worth, really, nothing *much*), so the situation is going to start garnering attention—and *quickly*.
- B had already been on the JLA comm line with Di and Supes, letting them *know* some terrible meta tech is going *down* and crazy, run amok scientists are up to their old tricks, shit is going down in Gotham for the next few days, and all around, get some people on A, B, and C
-
- He’ll use the excuse of checking the inventory of trackers for WTMS when he’s really confirming the gala with Tam and probably making the plan to trap Dick and Jason in the Perch while he attends
- The Bats converge, make him tell the truth because (yes) the White Triad is his theory. He still makes a weak argument for evidence, thus the crate and the code from the last chapters: “Nothing I have is strong enough for a definite,” he growls out. “Fuck, Timmy. How much more ya *need*? We gonna get one of ‘em ta piss in a cup or some shit?” “It’s them,” B’s calm pervades Dick’s relentless pacing and Jay’s infuriated aura, “you can admit it, Tim. It’s fine.” “Bruce-” “You have a stake in this, I get it. *We* get it. So you’re the lead, *but*,” and there’s the dangerous gleam, the hidden BatDad, “Do. Not. Go. This. Alone. Make us part of the plan and *keep it* that way.” B goes on because Tim’s been so stubborn about this and it’s time to break through with some BatDad pseudo-lecturing that actually sinks in, makes Tim turn away with his eyes wet because *dammit* B is so sincere. So, here’s the kicker, the trust fall. And even though he’s the guy that lies, the guy that can pass it off and keep moving, he finds himself unable to bullshit his way through it. This one *is *his, but if he becomes compromised, then yes, a back-up plan would be a pretty good *idea*. A long breath, a hard beat of his heart (because *fuck yes*, adding them to the sitch was going to be so *hard*, dangerous). “Okay,” he agrees slowly, surprising even himself.
- They go after the crates, find them full of *not* kids, but the final piece that maybe falls in for Tim. It’s the time stuff (so a link to the Architect) and the *big* plan. To make Meta soldiers, yes, but really to find the right combination of powers to disrupt *time*. Ra’s and supervillians working to set off the disruptions in time to manipulate it to their favor.
- He needs his direct connect for the Tower and thus, Dick and Jason follow him back to the Perch (where it’s Plan A time: through the day until he’s killed Dick and Jay with sexcapades and locks them in the Perch as he’s fixing his tie for the Gala)
- So the one on Kon is actually crucial to Ra’s big plan :D
- Which...ends up in the hands of the kiddos and Rob (which is how he can go do the thing)
-
- (well...it’s also a tracker, so I had to go back and edit the trackers out of the suit because, you know. Um, but! I have this poignant moment during the video when he traps them in the perch where he puts the tracker over his heart, all like, “it’s fine, I know you’ll come get me.”)
- ...wasn’t going to tell you this, BUT. What if Ra’s pretty much grabs him from a closet or something and greets with a hello detective before BAMF kidnapped CEO (again) and maybe...just to distract the detective long enough to drug him, he might just...kiss him or something? PASS THE DRUG THROUGH LIP CONTACT? HECK YEAH. AND I BET RA’S SLIPS IN TONGUE LIKE THE CREEP HE IS. CAN’T HELP BUT SNEAK A TASTE THAT BASTARD.
- O\_O
- YAAAASSSSS FUCK YES BRILLIANT!!
- He totally slips in tongue. And uses the rare plant as an excuse as Tim’s falling fucking unconscious and shit (OMG)
- (YES.) (ALL OF IT. TAKE ALL THE YES) I’m going to create a damn Fracture brainstorm doc on here I swear (I know it’s wonderful really) But still Ra’s is such a flashy fruitcake, I really do think he’d waltz in the gala, and persuade Tim to ‘join’ him on the balcony for that drugged kiss thing. (Also so the camera can catch it so the Batman and Dick and Jason get worried and distracted as heck, loves to rub that kind of douchery in their faces)
- True. He does like getting the last move, but he might not want to risk the exposure. The Titans and JLA couldn’t get the backers of the White Triad, they were literally in the wind (heh), so he might want to keep that cognito going long enough to “convince” the detective to see things his way.
-
- This is also a good point. He could possibly tape the kiss in the alcove/closet thing and send it though. Like as a taunt when Timothy is secured.
- ...Or, O could happen the catch a feed of Tim’s last known whereabouts and gets THAT thirty seconds of clip just before Baby Bird goes down and Ra’s...looks up at the camera and *smiles* (smarmy bastard)
- I LOVE IT. A LOT. (dang it what’s wrong with me, I almost just want Ra’s to take advantage of Tim silly, it’s horrible.)
- (Not really because the build-up between Tim and Ra’s, then Tim and the Bats make it a very close 50/50. Even if Dick and Jay *believed* Ra’s was doing something to Tim, even if Ra’s was just being more “handsy” than usual...that’s still a lot of *no no* and *yes, please*) Rawr, okay back to reading. Still looking forward to that dramatic entrance though. :D :D :D Kay want me to delete the part above?
- Lol, noted! When it’s time, we are so going to have a *talk*. NOPE. I have notes at the end of this thing, so I’m going to put this convo there :D
- Jason seductive moves: Well...hmmm. I think Jason loves to make Tim not hide, and in that snippet above where Jason puts together that ‘wow Timmy really does like them back, how did they not see it before’ I think he’d lay it out more. (Like Tim is not the only one who can multitask) Like more touches that are definite caresses. Him patting down Tim before they go out, adjusting his suit just a bit. “Looking good when your suit doesn’t suck huh, Tim?” Making little comments here and there, whether they be compliments, “Wow I love the way you kick ass, it makes your ass look better” (Pfft) or “I mean it Tim. Don’t get hurt. Please. Punch their lights out and come back to me” He’d also maybe make comments to Tim about what he’s gonna do to Dick once he gets his hands on him. “I’m gonna give ‘im a tongue-lashing and then–” “I know, I know.” “And who knows maybe it’ll take more than just one from me.” Eyes Timmy on the side to see if he gets what he means. Like even maybe bring up the moment in the shower. “‘Bout the shower, Babybird–” “It’s okay, it was biology, I get it.” “Oh, honey for me it’s a bit more than just the birds and the bees. Well I already told you I wanted ya to be my bird didn’t I?”
- On the way back, Jason’s driving one of the thug’s cars to ditch, Ducati’s in the back and he just thumbs Tim’s chin over, “Timmy, didn’t ‘cha tell me I was *your* Robin? I think that applies in more than one *meaning*.
