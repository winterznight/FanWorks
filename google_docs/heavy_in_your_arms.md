*Heavy in your arms*

*\*Inspired by Florence + the Machine’s song of the same name*

\*\*

*I was a heavy heart to carry*

He spits blood, vomits some bile and water while he’s at it.

*My beloved was weighed down*

The pain radiates hot and tight along his spine from the probable broken bones in his leg and abdomen, from bruised or torn viscera, from his body cavity finally giving *way*.

And it’s fine. All of it, *all of it*.

*My arms around his neck*

Because he should never have made it this far, not with the world fighting against him, not with his feet dragging every step of the mother*fucking* way. Not with destiny herself sending the Angel of Death to collect the *debt*.

*My fingers laced to crown*

He’s known it since he was a short little shit running the Narrows down, trying to keep food in his belly and make enough to pay rent so they didn’t get evicted. He’s always *known* he wouldn’t live to see eighteen. The fact he made it to fifteen is a miracle within itself.

But the trigger to it, the lynchpin, the *why* behind it all, is that he did this *to himself*. When B first found him trying to lift those tires, he should have told the vigilante to fuck off, to take him in for another blight on his record. He should have *never* put in the cape and tunic. Should *never* have let it go that goddamned *far*.

*I was a heavy heart to carry*

He’s been tainted since birth, his real mom giving him up because somewhere deep down, she *knew* what was growing in her womb was something rancid, something *tainted*. Something that should have died before it ever breathed his first. He should never have *lived*, nonetheless carried a good name straight to hell with him.

*My feet dragged across the ground*

His arms are little more than useless with blood loss and strain, the .45 loosely in his palm with his finger in the guard, but he doubts he could even lift the damn thing if he needed to.

(It’s fine. This is the way it shoulda ought always *been*. Only sorry’s I owe is to you, sweets. Just *you*)

The pier under his cheek is creaky and moist, rotting away because the fucking tree is *dead* and he feels a strange kinship, chalking it up to blood loss and *owfuck*.

*And he took me to the river*

“I’m sorry,” he rasps out, throat sore and hoarse. If he had enough left in him to move, he’d try to hit the tracer he *knows* was put in the suit. If he wasn’t content to just *be*, he would feel worse about leaving him behind, might feel scared going back down the long tunnel into the black. The *real* black, the one he came to from still in his coffin.

But there’s not enough to keep *fighting*. Fuck, he wishes he had just a little *more* to give, just enough to get to his feet, just enough to go back where things like warm and safe and love could wrap around him.

Thing he had when he was *that* Robin, things he didn’t think he’d ever have again.

*Where he slowly let me drown*

But s’allright. It’s going to be *fine* because he did his due. He stopped that psychotic nut job from killing everyone in the city. He did what *Robin* would have done, minding his P’s and Q’s, not killing the motherfucker and shoving his corpse off a roof.

For once, he did good.

(And what he wouldn’t give to hear that from B...now *that*, is funny, ain’t it, clown?)

Gray eating at his vision, taking away the sound of the water, making the familiar noises of Gotham muted in a soothing kind of way.

*My love has concrete feet*

Kory’s face flashes through, her smile small and sad for him (that time he woke her up with a nightmare from the Pit. She and Roy held onto him all night, keep him *tight* in their arms while he sobbed and babbled, half-mad with it). He knows he’s going when he hears *“Jaybird”* like a prayer, to things he tried to do *right*.

And *fuck* he *tried*. He tried so hard with them. Tried to do what had to be done, to be what they both needed.

*My love’s an iron ball*

But that’s just the way of it. No matter what, no matter that he tried to keep *fighting* for the right *reasons*, it always went sideways, left his path swathed in destruction, more blood coating his hands.

He’d never be clean, not with alla it staining his fucking *soul*.

But as his vision is finally fading and his thoughts slowing to a syrupy mass, he thinks he feels hands on him, familiar hands, careful, gentle hands, hands that were everything he *needed*.

*Wrapped around your ankles*

He almost sobs out loud with the ghost sensations because *this is the only thing he regrets*. After all the fighting, all the misunderstanding, all the residual hurts, how far they’ve come, how hard they fought to be *here*, how much he fucking *hates* to see pain on that face…

But if there’s one thing he can’t fight, he can’t *win* against, it’s Fate. When all the cards are stacked against him, when he’s outta tricks to pull in hopes of a last-ditch salvation, when the contingencies all *fail*, then it’s time to admit he’s done the best he could with his second chance and settle up his final debts with Death.

“I’m sorry,” he might say again while his face is wet against the pier. “Never meant ta get this gone for you…”

*Over the waterfall*

And he finally gives in, the dark washing over him, his heart beating with nothing but *pain* because he can’t be as strong as he needs to be, as he has to be, as he should be, to be worthy of that stupid asshole. He couldn’t be what was really *needed*, not as Robin, not as the Red Hood, not as a *man* in love.

His last thoughts trickle out into the dark while the city is blocked out and the pain subsides, fades to dull twinges in his numbing body--

Maybe, he did the right thing after all.

*I was a heavy heart to carry*

\*\*\*\*\*\* satire wanted part II

\*\*\*\*\*\* satire wanted part II

*I’m so heavy*

Whirl of colors. The spasm of his gut and throat, bile and cold sea water. Fist in his diaphragm, forcing the rancid waterfall *out*.

Pain racing up his spine and his fingers form claws even in the sodden gloves, ready to start tearing at the flimsy silk covering wood and plastic trapping him, ready to start *from the inside*:

—Screaming until he’s spitting blood, torn something there (that’s why his voice is *fucked* even now)

—Crying for Bruce: *save me, don’t leave me in the ground to rot* (but you *fucked up*, didn’t you? Why would he come save the Robin who *failed*? *Who would?*)

*Heavy*

—It’s dark and I’m *scared* (and now he’s forgotten how to fear the night, never fucking again)

—Where...*Why?* (because you should have never went after her. If you’d have *stayed*, the clown wouldn’t have taken your stupid ass the fuck apart. Shoulda put a gun in your mouth instead, not like you don’t always chicken the fuck *out*)

—Broken, bleeding fingernails (but getting through all that earth, and the first breath of tainted Gotham air was like *salvation*)

—Air...have to have *air* (no, asshole. You should have just fucking *stayed dead*)

*Heavy in your arms*

In and out. Things are flashes and snatches when he gets snippets. Movement kills it because his leg is muted but still a mess with inevitable *pain* waiting on the outskirts with a whole lotta *lemme talk at ‘chu for a minute*.

The blood loss might have made him slightly more insane than the Pit. *Slightly* because he’s seeing things in starks and spectrums. He’s the guy what always saw shit in shades of grays.

*I’m so heavy,*

Seeing things in *color*, just like *him*, his boy. Always had to be on the opposite ends of the scale because in some way they both *got* it— that bitch, Justice? Blind as fucking *bat*, yeah?

He snorts at it while the wind dries his hair and *fuck* he’s getting hit in the face with the battering of a *cape*, telling how far *gone* he’s got to be at this juncture.

B wouldn’t come for him, that *shit* is just plain stupid.

*Heavy*

But as stupid as it is, the kid in him buried in some dark corner, some un-*fucked* inch of his *soul*, the kid that coulda, woulda, shoulda been the *right *Robin...the part he can’t carve out, no matter how *sharp* the knife is, how strong the steel, how covered in gore it’s gets in his hand, that part still fucking *hopes*.

—*Save me, Bruce.*

Stupid little punk. Didn’t cha learn any better? You already done proved you ain’t worth the effort.

*Heavy in your arms*,

Out.

Back with it to the low, dulcet tone of a wrought-iron fire escape. One of the sturdy ones built back in the twenties when they intended shit to *last*. He can place himself by that noise alone— it’s the block of apartments on 152nd, *his* side of Gotham. He knows every building and bolt hole, all the old trolley stations (from back when it was *the talk of Gotham*, before it became the Narrows and dilapidated into drugs and low-income housing) and closed entrances to the subways, he knows the niches.

He knows where sin lives. Just another mark in the book, baby. Ya know I got it in *spades*.

*And is it worth the wait?*

The safe house is one of his. He knows it by the way the creaking mattress shoves a spring into his ass cheek.

Death seems further off since his leg is set in a complicated splint and elevated. Bodysuit is gone and his ribs wrapped just this side of too much. Someone was pissy about picking him up off the pier.

When he gets an eyeful of the slumped bird beside his shoulder on the bed, he gives a rough huff because some *assholes* have to show up like the motherfucking cavalry or some shit.

(Lemme go. When it’s time, Timmy, it’s ***time****.*)

He has enough in him to lift the hand just enough to fit at the back of Tim Drake’s neck, being smooth and easy with it. His fingers work up to scratch lightly at Tim’s scalp just like he’s seen his boy do a hundred times, knows it’s Red’s weakness.

*All This Killing Time?*

“You. Fucking. *Asshole*.”

Sounds about right.

“What do you think *he* would do if he heard half the made *fucking* ramblings I heard *last night*?”

Pacing, moving, doing because Timmy gets *that *kind of pissed off. You know, *royally*. He’s still in the Red Robin body suit, thrumming with energy now that some of them are going to live like the rest of the shithead population. At present, he’s cutting up a banana with *feeling*. One he apparently ain’t shy about sharing.

“Fucking up your second chance? Just *giving up* and *I’m sorry*.”

He winces for the banana.

*Are you strong enough to stand?*

“Timmy, c’mon, calm it down. Coming close...ain’t easy fer me. Gets my head all jacked-up with the…” and is he *really* going to do this? He and Baby Bird are good now, can work together, can snark, can siddown and have a burger on the ledge of the Wallstone. He has his own code into the Perch, got a coffee mug and set of pajamas.

But he’s never—

Only with Kory and Roy. Only with his boy.

And only when it tries to cut itself *out*. When it’s poison in the back of his throat.

*Protecting both your heart and mine?*

But it’s got Timmy turned away from the counter, facing him in the dim dawn starting to eek through the blinds. And Baby Bird is calm, rant tuning down, giving him the weight of his stare and full attention.

“It’s like,” and he has to look away, to stare up at the ceiling, to blink and keep himself away from the final moments, to gather a whole *different* kind of strength, “alla the bad comes first ‘cause....’cause I don’t remember enough of the other side to know if it *matters*, you feel me? The first time I was a shithead, but I died as Robin, trying ta save my mother, and...it was fucking *noble*. But when it comes again...Timmy, when it comes for me again, what if the good don’t outweigh the bad?”

*Who is the betrayer?*

“What if the scales ain’t never gonna be square now? ‘Cause I got ta come *back*.”

*Who’s the killer in the crowd?*

“What if I don’t get anywhere but *gone*. Maybe you don’t get the choice again. Who fucking *knows?*”

*The one who creeps in corridors*

“And the only good things I got to offer up...the only thing I done *right* this time...is that I made it square with you...and...and with him.”

*And doesn’t make a sound*

He must be hitting shock or something because he doesn’t even hear Timmy *move*. There’s just warmth when he’s already so fucking *cold* inside and out. Just like first waking up when all he could see was darkness and the inside of that casket wasn’t as comfortable as it looked to the meatbags on legs lookin’ down.

But his hands can move just enough to grip Tim’s shoulders from behind, he can lay his face in the side of that neck and be fucking grateful.

*My love has concrete feet*

The window gives under real strength, banging fast and hard.

He comes up enough to snag the .45, not screaming when the pain train hits *full speed ahead*. Tim’s already got pellets, even though he’s holding the younger of them to his hurting chest with his free hand because he *ain’t gonna let Timmy go down that path before it’s his time*—

When Nightwing leaps through, fast and furious, a whirl of feral destruction. Every muscle in his body is tense, a beautiful picture in that *suit*, and he must be feeling the glad-ta-still-be-breathings because he can appreciate his boy animalistic grace when he’s utterly *pissed the hell off*.

It’s always a sight to behold.

Tonight? It’s even better.

*My love’s an iron ball*

And the slow roll of those hips is the start of something utterly terrifying, the first Robin, former Titan, former Batman, and a whole lot of sexually charged vigilante powerhouse could be gearing up for a massive roundhouse to start the fight or could be a breath away from ripping your fucking clothes off to give you the ride *of your life*.

Or.

Could be hitting the wall with such stark *relief* that’s an inescapable hold and lips on his forehead, always a soft Romani prayer a litany against evil, a plea of protection and strength.

But his boy *knows*. Knows him down to the *bone*. Is achingly soft and easy, the whiteouts up on the mask so those blue eyes are overwhelming.

*Wrapped around you ankles*

“M’ sorry, sweets,” is rough because almost drowning had that effect, but his boy is a sucker for the real pet names, always has been.

“You *asshole*,” Nightwing pulls off the domino to becomes his baby, his sweet, his sugar (his redemption, his avenger, his guardian angel), and the arms get tighter, making the pain arch in his abdomen, but it ain’t all that. Naw, there’s always *worse*.

*Over the waterfall*

“You should have waited. I said I was on the way.”

*Wouldn’ta mattered. We both know that*.

“I was almost too you when the warehouse exploded. Jesus, Jay, I thought— I thought…”

“Aw, naw, sweets,” and he’s pressing his mouth under his boy’s watery eyes, “I’ma hard motherfucker ta kill. Ain’tcha figured that out yet?”

“*Fuck that*, we both know better.” And those eyes spill over, making tracks through the dirt of Gotham still on his face.

*This will be my last confession*

If only...if only he could be the man his boy *deserves*.

Instead, he’s the man he *knows* how to be, and draws the older vigilante down to fit their mouths together in a sloppy rendition of what might be a kiss, but is more breathing each other’s air, gripping each other to make sure it ain’t just a *dream*.

And he don’t have ta see it ta know his boy is gripping Timmy’s hand like a lifeline, like he’s a part of *them*.

He also knows Timmy’s gripping back just as tight.

*I was a heavy heart to carry*

*My beloved was weighed down*

*My arms around his neck*

*My fingers laced to crown*

None of them bitch when the two mobile vigilante strip down to boxers and crawl in bed with him. Tim’s cheeks and upper chest are a disturbing shade of red, but they don’t comment on it, not when they can’t let go of him any more than they can let go of one another.

They bracket him easy-like so the knee under his restrained leg takes some of the pressure off, and two fingers push hard enough to make the nerve clusters blissfully silent instead of radiating to his pain receptors.

His face is nestled in the crook of his boy’s neck, those long fingers rubbing soothing circles on the back of his neck while they all ignore the shamefully wet hitches in his breathing.

His grip is tight in Tim’s hair again, his shaky hand scratching against Baby Bird’s scalp to punctuated the *point*.

*I was a heavy heart to carry*

*But he never let me down*

*When he held me in his arms*

*My feet never touched the ground*

And it’s a crazy thing, one that strikes him at dark places where he stores the old pain and remorse, how he never thought he’d be *worth* this kind of grief. How no one would be stupid enough to mourn a piece of shit like him. A stupid kick what got himself offed.

But while his phone lights up with worried texts from Roy and Kory, while B is on his boy’s comm demanding to know the Red Hood didn’t bite the big one again, while Alfred is stress baking and B is pleading for them to put him on so Alf will just *chill the fuck out*, while Timmy grips him, nuzzles a warm nose into his cold jugular, and his boy holds him in the present, those dark corners get...just a little bit of light.

Not too much to taint the darkness in his soul, just a slice enough so he can see how bright and white it is, so he can remember how warm it was to move into the first time, so he doesn’t have to be as afraid when the next time inevitably rolls around again.

*I’m so heavy…*

*So heavy in your arms...*
