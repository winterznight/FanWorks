Note: Katsuki’s damn hero name is Ground Zero in this fic and I have no fucks to give about it.

The Quirk isn’t one they’ve come across to date, but it’s one of the worst possible tropes *ever*.

And if there’s anything hero-worshipping Izuku Mydoria *knows *–

– it’s tropes.

His last year at U.A. gave him the most time-consuming, simultaneously *epic* and *frustrating* proof of his dedication to the art of all things *fanboy*.

Uraraka-kun introduced him to *fanfiction*.

His final work study before graduation happened with Kaachan and Todoroki-kun, just as seamless as it had for their first and following internships. Somehow, the three of them got paired together to learn and grow and get stronger side-by-side.

This year specifically since he’s still riding on the tails of taking on All for One with the entirety of class by his side, his friends, his *allies*, his teammates but *also* being able to keep One for All after the demise of AFO so he can continue his journey to be Number One, to make sure he’s going to do his *damnest* to make the world keep *smiling*. But this year back at Endeavor’s, he’s facing even more pressure w-with Ka-chan sometimes calling him *Izukuu* in *that voice*. With Todoroki sometimes looking at him like...like *that* when he thinks Midorya isn’t paying attention.

(*He’s a normal teenager and Kaachan and Shoto-kun are so, so handsome with crazy powerful quirks and both of them are absolutely incredible in their own ways and he’s just! He’s… he’s not even sure really*.)

But. But *anyway*.

Fanfiction. A chance lunch he had with her and Ida-kun over the summer gave him room to *breathe* after so much close proximity to Kaachan and Shotou-kun since they’ve been taking on their own cases for Endeavor and working together like real Pro Heroes.

(*Long hours of surveillance in hotel rooms. Taking shifts sleeping and watching, Shoto coming out of a steamy bathroom with damp hair and bare chest. Kaachan sleeping in just tiny boxer briefs that are horribly *painful* to look at when he wakes up soft and sleep-mussed and *smirking*, always *smirking* at Midorya’s pink face like such a *jerk* and pointing it *out*. And. And he’s *human*. No hero ever would be un-unaffected by them, right?*)

So. He’s having a crisis. And he has approximately three options to survive until graduation or he is literally going to *die*.

It would be utterly humiliating to die from unrequited *lust* and what is obviously a healthy dash of teenage hormones.

1. Simply explode from the pressure.
2. Get caught frantically doing private things in the shower with their names in his mouth when he finishes.
3. Have an outlet that won’t judge him and let him ramble-rant about *what is even his life right now, didn’t he help save, you know, the *world*?? *

And Uraraka-kun is one of the *best* people to ever *exist*. If anyone will be honest with him, it’s her.

It warmed his heart when Ida-kun was bluntly encouraging. “Midorya, as the class rep, it’s my *responsibility* to know what’s going on with our class, academically and socially, so I can do my best to encourage everyone to be at the top of their game. I take that seriously.”

“Please continue to do your best for me.”

“Of course,” and Ida sipped his tea while Uraraka-kun side-eyed him with pink cheeks (*that Ida-kun didn’t even *notice*, sigh*). “So. You’re having a crisis then?”

After getting his air back from choking, he went over the basics, that maybe...maybe he just liked-liked someone...s? And-and it could be very bad if that–those someones ever found out. It would be so so so *so* bad and awful but he just can’t *help it*.

It goes completely over his head how not-obvious he’s being here. Doesn’t get it when Ida and Uraraka turn to one another and shut him down with a perfectly timed head nod.

“Bakugo and Todoroki.”

His faceplant into the table makes him a complete loser for an almost-professional hero, but *dammit,* he’s having a *crisis* and before he knows it, half the class *is gonna know*.

“Look, Mido-kun,” Uraraku sighs at his horrified face, “anyone, and I mean *anyone* would be at a… crossroads when you have those two to look at every day,” she shrugs carelessly while Ida-kun chokes this time. “Why don’t you try to devote your attention to something else? Take your mind off of them?”

“L-Like what?”

“Hm, yes *Ochako*. What do you suggest?”

It’s totally Midorya’s imagination, subtly looking between the two of them while their eyes meet over their cups.

“Well,” she clears her throat and refocuses on Deku, but he notices the light pink there. “Your other interest is studying quirks and heroes, right? Try getting into some fandoms or something. I’m sure there’s tons of fanfics out there about All Might saving the day and taking on quirk users no one has ever heard of before. Two birds with one stone.”

So he *does*. Granted, he’s desperate.

But, come to find out there’s so many, so *many* places where fans write all kinds of amazing stories, share their headcanons, their own analysis of quirks, that his spare time is spent navigating down the black hole that is fandom content that he is in *heaven*.

But the inevitable shift took him to Archive of Their Own and filtering and so many stories on All Might and Endeavor and Best Jeanist and Aizawa-san, Hawks, Yoroi-san, Kamui Woods, and-and then he found stories about-about (*them*) his class and of course because they were the strongest and the coolest –

Stories about Kaachan and Todoroki-kun. Stories that were-were tagged with things that couldn’t make him look *away* (*Pro Hero Bakugou Katsuki, Bakagou Katsuki swears a lot, Prince Todoroki Shoto, dominant!Katsuki, dominant!Todoroki, bottom!bakugo, top!bakugo, top!todoroki, switch!todoroki, and-and more dirty ones that he bookmarked so fast his thumb creaked…*)

They’ve got a few months left and he’s back to the UST killing him because now he *knows things*. He *knows*.

The moment it all goes sideways, is when the phantom, unbelievably tropey quirk hits them when they’ve almost solved the last case of their final internship, already on the way *out* to the last semester of classwork and final training before graduation.

What should have been *easy*, what should have been *routine*, turns in the blink of an eye.

It’s a terrifying moment when the heat takes over.

Ground Zero and Shoto are hit in a wave, both recognizing the unmistakable difference between someone else’s Quirk and their own. The flare in spine and stomach is oddly familiar if not momentarily unwelcome.

From across the dingy alley where the suspect had ducked long enough to gather enough power to release his Quirk on both of them as they were rounding the corner, hell bent on taking him down, their eyes met in joint realization.

This heat is meant for bedrooms and bare skin.

“Mother*fuck*,” through gritted teeth as Ground Zero glances at his partner. “This ain’t good, Sho.” His knees give way, shoulder scraping along rough brick as he slides to the dirty ground.

Shoto blinks sluggishly at Ground Zero, but pink has already taken over his cheeks and a familiar daze glazing over his multi-colored eyes. Ground Zero swallows hard, his mouth literally *watering* for everything he could *do* right now, how he could make Half n’ Half look so much more positively *wrecked*, how he could make Shoto give up those *sounds* – needy and high-pitched, breathy and utterly *sinful*.

Ground Zero has no idea he’s staring at one of his work-study partners with a hungry, half-feral expression, eyes narrow behind the mask, shoulders and back tense for the *strike*.

Shoto makes a visible effort to shake himself, to just *breathe through it*. He’s trained to withstand worse than this. His body won’t beat him (*and he very carefully tries not to look at Bakagou’s face, to see what’s waiting there, to know his own wants are reflected back at him*). “All right, we’ve got to call it in, Zero. We’re too compromised to chase him further.”

Ground Zero closes his eyes for a second, tries to get himself the *fuck* together, tries to stop *thinking* about it, about sucking red marks into muscle and thudding pulse under his hand, about the two of them holding up their writhing desperate crush between them with this heat in his blood hotter than his *usual*.

*Fuck, Deku between us all sweet and soft and *pliant. *All theirs for the taking*.

He slaps a hand over his mouth while Sho bites down on his lip at a warm surge, muscles going lax rather than tensing up against the power slicing through his most sensitive spots.

His other hand unconsciously reaching out, Katsuki has to visibly rein himself in, to remember where they *are*. In the middle of their sector with a numb nut dumbass taking off to cause more mayhem while the two of them are making *fuck me* eyes at one another.

This is not where he saw his last week at Endeavor’s agency going. Their last year at UA, weeks before final graduation, the Big Three together for one last hurrah giving Shoto’s old man as much hell as that sonofabitch can *handle*, and some *extra* hits him in one of his few weaknesses (*which just happens to be one Shoto Todoroki, the other...his Deku*). “Dammit, Sho, he’s gonna get away if we don’t fucking *do something*–”

The sound of a zipper lowering a little on Sho’s jumpsuit is enough to make him clench his fists, close his eyes when the heat shoots up his spine again.

(*Throat and chest, pink skin waiting for his hands, his ****mouth***… Well, fuck.)

“Won’t happen,” Shoto pants out, “not if we call...*him*.”

The heavy sigh from Katsuki is the proverbial nail in their collective coffin.

Shoto taps the comm in his ear and clears his throat before speaking, trying to get rid of the automatic drop when he thinks, talks about *him* (*Midorya*), and calls into headquarters.

“This is intern Shoto. Suspect used an unknown Quirk on me and intern Ground Zero. We need backup and quickly. Suspect is on foot. We’re too compromised to follow.”

Dispatch confirms back-up and rescue teams are on the way.

It’s only when he mutes the comm does he let himself fold, sliding down the alley wall to sit as far from his partner as possible, the illusion of *space*.

(*Before he does something they’ll both regret doing out in public rather than behind closed doors*.)

He can see the same thoughts shifting in Katsuki’s eyes, the mask barely hiding the intensity, the way his eyes slid down Shoto’s throat and chest, to the knee drawn up to hide what the Quirk is doing to him.

\*\*

It’s been more than a year, almost two, since they’ve gone Pro and any mention of *him* sets both of them on *edge*.

(*Even when Midoryia left almost immediately after graduation from UA to the United States, when the horrific events of their last few months before graduation stayed secret behind the silent wall Hero Deku had become with the two of them…*)

In America, news comes over at how much he’s improving, how much he’s *doing* with those other heroes, with the team he’s leading during his time on a Hero Visa to the United States. The interviews are recorded on the DVR should Bakugo and Todoroki be working and miss any. A few months away and Deku looks thinner but broader in the shoulders and chest. Another few months and he’s sporting a completely different hair style, shaved underneath and long on top; he’s beaten and bloody talking to the reporters, but he’s smiling all goofy when he thanks the rescue teams and other heroes that worked so well together. Months more and he’s got studs in the upper lobe of his ear. A pause and zoom makes Katsuki muffle a groan in his hand because one stud is his signature orange X and the other, half flame, half ice for the Hero Shoto.

He and Sho debauch the *fuck* out of their couch when they both realize Deku got pierced – to wear *their marks*.
