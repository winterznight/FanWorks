I refuse to lie about this.

This? Totally got the idea by watching animated porn. Google “priapus movie.” If you check it out, you’ll get the references.

From the Heavens, the Father of the Gods looks into the seeing waters at the realm of mortals. The young man with a soft smile, raven black hair, and shockingly violet eyes draws Bruce’s sighs, his son long denied him.

A promise to the boy’s mother while she carried their halfling child, that he would allow their son twenty-one years on Earth to live among other mortals. Once he came of age in their world, then he could be told about the Gods and brought into his power.

The more his three other sons clashed nowadays, it’s become obvious the boy is sorely needed.

Alfred, his second-in-command of their heavenly armies, stands by his right hand, watches the boy smile at a customer and hand over warm beverages humans seem to enjoy.

“He is certainly your blood, Sire,” Alfred comments idly, wondering how the mortals could be so dense as to not see the blatant appeal of the boy behind the counter. His face, while handsome with his father’s strong jawline, is pale with otherworldly beauty. His eyes shine with peace at every person that steps up to speak with him.

“Indeed. It is finally time for him to come home and take part in his birthright, old friend.”

Alfred turns away from the half-God they’re observing, “it has been a long time coming, hasn’t it, Sire?”

For a moment, the Father of the Gods, the former Titan, Bruce, looks sadly at the boy, hands fisting on the edge of the seeing water’s cradle. Even stone here in the Heavens would crumble under his fists.

“It is beyond time, my old friend. It is time he comes home.”

\*\*

He is back to sitting on the throne when his three sons answer his call.

Dick, his firstborn, the God of the Elements.

Jason, his second born, the God of the Underworld.

Damian, his youngest, the God of War.

When the three appear before the massive door to his throne room, their voices echoing, the surge of pride in them fills his chest to near overflowing. His sons all grown into Gods of valor and might.

“Damn, Goldie,” Jason teases, a salacious grin at his brother’s normal tight body suit perfectly outlining every salacious inch. He pinches the material between two fingers, a contrast to his sharp, black, three-piece suit and the Demon’s intricate armor. “Betcha get all hot n’ bothered when it’s time ta *hunt,* ya feel me?”

Dick just snorts at his younger brother, knocking his hand away to sweep the taller God up in both arms and hold him off the ground.

“I know that just means you missed me, Jay. We haven’t seen each other since that last fight in the Underworld, when those underlings tried to overthrow you. We made a great pair, remember?”

Damian removes his helm, rolling his eyes at the antics of his older siblings, tries to remember *he* is the bright one of the family. (*Even though he would obviously say Barbara is the smartest and Cassandra the most fearsome*.)

“Yeah, yeah. Good ta see ya, too. Now pum’me down.”

“Aw, you’re no fun anymore. Where’s the snarky little hellion I used to give noogies?”

“See, that’s what policin’ damned souls does ta ya, yeah?”

Grinning behind his hand at their bickering, the Father of the Gods stands from his throne, strides down the white and gold steps, waves a hand to open the massive gold doors to his throne room to take in each of his sons into his arms, warm to his core at how well each still fits into his embrace even all grown up.

“Not to worry,” Bruce interrupts their banter. “Your sisters will see to everything while you are gone.”

He has their attention, and sighs, palming the side of Dick’s face, ruffling the white streak in Jason’s hair, and finally rests a hand on the back of Damian’s neck.

“Gone?” Damian’s immediate reaction is suspicion because Father gives the utterly *worst tasks*.

“Barbara can handle being the Goddess of the Elements. Cassandra will make a formidable Goddess of War, and Helena will… *enjoy* taking on Goddess of the Underworld.”

“Not likin’ th’ sound’a this,” Jay straightens, slides his fingers over the lapels of his suit, smoothes out the lines.

“If this is anything like the last few *adventures*, Bruce, you can just send someone else–“ Because, yeah, Dick has other things to do than run all over the place on another crazy God hunt.

No thanks.

But rather than use the usual methods to gain their agreement, their great Father instead… *sighs*.

“The truth, my sons, is that I have called you all here because this undertaking is of the utmost importance. I can trust only you three, no others. But, more to the point, I don’t think any but all of you together can accomplish it in time.” And it’s jarring to see the Father of the Gods look sad, tired, *worn* in the way of mortals. “In many ways, I am…torn that you will learn the truth in this manner, but come! Let me show you instead.” He leads them to the viewing pool where Alfred stands idly watching.

The younger Gods crowd around the delicate bowl seemingly grown from the floor, full of the prophetic waters, a gift from Barbara.

For Father to need them like this, a task *only* his first sons could accomplish, they’re all a bit breathless wondering what this could possibly be.

“A mortal?” Dami sounds less insulted than surprised, staring into the image in the waters. “A mere mortal, Father? It takes *thousands* to wage a decent battle.”

A second glance when Jason’s eyes narrow, when Richard leans further over the waters, licking his lips, and Damian pauses, tilts his head to be certain he is not imagining it.

A blink, a glance at his enraptured brothers, and the gentle *glow* about the mortal man, the curve of his pink mouth in a welcoming smile, the vibrant blue-violet of his eyes, the curve of biceps and shoulders, the way he merely *moves* is –

Mesmerizing.

“He ain’t a mortal. *Can’t be*. N’ I’d *know* if he was one a’ mine masquaradin’ on Earth,” Jay leans his forearms down on the water’s vessel. “I can letta demon be *beautiful*, don’t geddit wrong. But that sweet lil’ innocent is something *else* entirely, ya feel me?”

“But he’s in the mortal world,” Dick reasons, looking back at what he assumes is their next *prey*. “He functions like he belongs there,” he gestures to the man taking money from customers, talking with a soft grace, a kindness they can feel through the waters without hearing a word.

“He should not be,” Damian’s hands tighten on the vessel, delicate gold and white creaking with the strength of it. “Mortals cannot see what he is as we can. They could–“ *cause him harm, take him, own him*, almost leaves the God of War’s lips. He balks at that line of reasoning, but still, his mouth waters in anticipation, his eyes cannot look away.

The Father of the Gods nods sagely, a worn sigh raising his chest, “unfortunately, he has borne many burdens from living in the mortal world. Some that would have broken a lesser creature. But, as you can see, my sons, he remains steadfast.”

Dick hums, still watching as the mortal is now apparently taking a large stack of cups from a plastic sleeve and putting them back down on some kind of holder. Seemingly ordinary as they come, but if this is the subject of their father’s attention, there must be more than meets the eye. As the eldest, he’s very well *aware* of their Father’s tendencies for a good, dramatic quest.

“As much as I enjoy watching him,” and that is no false statement, not with how beautiful and soft and sweet this mortal absolutely is, “what does he have to do with us?”

Their Father breathes in sharply, “the matter is…complicated. What I want you to do is bring him here before me. I wish to finally see him with my own eyes.”

All three of his sons straighten, yell out denials of such a thing.

“It would kill him!” Damian raises a fist.

“Ya know a mortal can’t take alla this,” Jay waves a hand in B’s general direction.

“It would be kinder to end him with one shot,” Dick’s tone is flat, but he unconsciously positions his body between the viewing vessel and his great, *powerful* Father.

And Bruce, under the angry eyes of his sons, looks away. “It’s true he is mortal, but… he is only *half*.“

And now the boy’s ethereal beauty, softly glowing aura, the very subtle allure is answered when his sons look back, and their want for him *doubles*.

(A halfling. A mixture of man and God that could be a spectrum of delectable creatures. Most were brought to the Amazons for safe keeping, as the eventual maturation into their power as a divine event would surely give them away to mortals and other less ethical Gods. In a word, a truly *earth-shattering* awakening.)

“This is why I can only entrust what must be done to the three of you.” Bruce looks between them at his long-missing son, long separated from him, and back to his beautiful Godlings. He pulls at the strings he knows are connected, “Only another God can bring him into his power so he is strong enough to stand before me. But, he is…unique. A single God cannot do it alone, but the three of you together. You, my sons, may be strong enough to awaken him. As it is, I fear another could come upon him first…and possibly takes him for themselves.”

As he predicted, Jason’s eyes narrow, a deceptively casual flip of his fine suit coat. Damian’s mouth raises in an *over my bleeding corpse* sneer, hand hovering over his sheathed weapon. And Dick arches a brow at their Father, arms crossed over his bare chest. While he absolutely sees through his Father’s ploy, he can’t help the throb in his veins to hunt, catch, keep when he thinks about any of his fellow Gods or Goddesses coming upon this apparent halfling before they do.

“All right, all right,” Jay flips a half-assed salute, “we getcha, B. Ain’t gotta be a manipulative asshole ‘bout it.”

Dick snickers because well, it isn’t a lie.

Their great Father shrugs a shoulder, “I’m giving you the evidence you need to understand how important this is, Jason. This halfling is…special. Even I do not know what power he may bring forth once it is his time to awaken. The water itself will show no further future for him,” and an arm gestures to the view of the mortal.

All three of his sons noticeably perk. Nothing like a good mystery to reel them in.

\*\*

It’s a totally normal, sane day.

And you know what? That’s nice once and a while.

With the tips he got yesterday, he’s going to be able to make his rent on time and being, you know, *not homeless* really is a thing worth celebrating.

Steph hands him the next order, and the two of them move around one another behind the counter in that comfortable way when you work so well with someone, it’s like the two of you share a brain.

When it gets busy in the evening close to closing time, they get a nice little rush of people to close out the night.

They’ve got ten minutes, but most the machines at καφές (or ka-feys) are already cleaned and ready for tomorrow morning’s shift. Steph is whistling behind the counter while she counts out the tip jar, smoothing out wrinkled bills and cashing out the change for more dollars.

“It never fails,” she bemoans while he wipes down the back counters, “we make *bank* any time you are front and center, Timmers.”

His face gets pink where she can’t see and he scoffs for appearances, “people like seeing you more than they like seeing me, you know.”

“The bouncy, energetic vibe doesn’t always do the trick. Apparently the boy-next-door Hallmark type really does.”

He turns, clearly *offended here* because he works out when he can, was a gymnast in high school and everything!

He’s not a Hallmark throwback, fuck you very much.

“This is why I hate you.”

“Lies. You love me,” she makes kissy noises while he rings out the bleach rag and carries the bucket back to empty in the kitchen sink.

Toss of the day rag in the dirty bin, wash up a few remaining dishes while he hums to himself, stoked about having enough in tips to splurge for a pizza with some left to go into savings for the *someday* when he can go back and finish college.

He thinks about his lonely little apartment buried in a tenement building a few blocks away in the infamous big city. Just one more sad story in a building of sad stories trying to make the next day count.

If anyone had asked him five years ago where he’d be on his twenty-first birthday, this probably wouldn’t have been the answer.

The bell chimes with *incoming*, and he groans to himself as he’s on way through the swinging door, wondering which machine he’s going to have to dirty up to make whatever this asshole–

(*The three men at his counter immediately zoom in on him, three sets of incredible eyes make him pause a moment, and luckily not melt into a proverbial puddle on the floor because this trio of man sandwich? Are the most breathtaking men he’s ever seen outside of a magazine, movie, or tasteful porn. He finds his heart picking up, beating harder in his chest, his face getting warm, his mouth watering when a quick mental flash of clothes on his bedroom floor is just the birthday gift he’s been waiting for.*)

\-*wants*.

Tim puts on his best *how can I help you *smile with his pulse thudding dully in the back of his mouth.

“Welcome to καφές,” and Steph totally appears magically by his side, like her inner wingwoman instincts called, staring at the buffet in front of them. “What can we make for you?”

\*\*

Jason, Damian, and Dick.

This feels like a joke somehow.

It’s a joke because all three of these god-tier hotties seem to be…flirty? Kind of super obviously?

Steph sighs as she makes the Americano, watches Tim over her shoulder as he rings up the customers, and the one with the smooth accent literally puts a $100 bill in the tip jar.

*In the tip jar*

Without looking away from Tim.

The younger one has attitude for days, but he’s putting on the charm when he asks for Tim’s name (c’mon, we have *name tags*) in a low purr, and what would Timothy *suggest* for someone who likes light and sweet, hands on the counter close to Tim’s in a perfectly casual way.

The leaner one, who has an ass that could be considered out-of-this-world-*hot, *literally puts a hand on Tim’s, nodding with attentive eyes while Tim gives them the specials of the day (*for the third time*), and Steph comes very close to burning the *shit* out of herself while making his latte.

(They are *so obvious. Tim what are you even doing right now? *Why, *whyyy* isn’t her best friend telepathy working RIGHT. NOW?!)

They’re from out-of-town, on some business, and know nothing of the sights. Would he happen to be from Gotham? Could he suggest a nice hotel where they might *get accommodations?*

It’s right then. Right. Then.

She has to do something.

Because they? Are *best friends*. And she is *invested as hell* getting him laid.

(After that awful break-up with Conner last year, he hasn’t gotten back on the proverbial horse. And this? Is his opportunity *of a literal lifetime*.)

“Tim! Could you help me just a minute–“ is sweet and soft, her smile warm and welcoming. “If you guys wouldn’t mind having a seat over there, Tim can bring your drinks in a jiffy!”

The *looks* are absolutely sinful and even her sweet best should be picking up on the UST less than a foot away from him. She bites the inside of her cheek at how pink his face is when their customers finally take a few steps away from the counter.

She pulls him back around the set-up to the sinks by one wrist, almost hopping up and down with excitement.

“Wh-what did you need help with? Did the espresso machine go down again?”

“Are you fricking *kidding me right now?*” She whispers furiously, “Tim. Timmy. Honey. Sweet Summer Child. You are going to listen up and do exactly as I say.”

Now he’s rolling his eyes because something is definitely coming that he isn’t going to like.

“You are going to take out their drinks, and tell them you know a perfectly nice hotel not far from here. If they seem interested, you’re going to tell them you’d be happy to give them directions or maybe *show* them where. Le Grande is only a few blocks away, and you might have a chance to be the jelly in *that sandwich*.”

“Are you serious?” He deadpans. “They’re just…being nice. It’s late, they want coffee,” he shrugs awkwardly, “you know. Just really friendly people?”

“This is Gotham,” she deadpans back, “there are no friendly people. But they? Are *so* into you. Take their drinks, tell them you know where they can stay the night, a place with a nice bar and good reputation. If they invite you to have some birthday drinks with them, then, for the love of *God*, Tim, say *yes*. Maybe if you get a few in you, they’ll invite you to their *room* for a game of hide the salami. If they do, you’d better come back with *stories for days*.”

“I love you, but you make me crazy,” and he walks around to finish up the drinks, shaking his head with a grin. “C’mon, like I would even show up on their radar? I’m betting CEOs or Hollywood kept husbands.”

And now the game has begun. Steph goes around behind him to clean-up the mess. “Tallest is an underwear model. I’ll accept nothing less, not with an ass like that.”

“Unless they’re in porn,” he comes back with a lowered voice, chancing a glance over his shoulder to find the three beautiful men looking back at him from the only table still with chairs on the ground.

“I can see it,” she returns with a laugh, “I mean. They are off the charts.” But she gives him the side-eye, bites down when he is completely *gone*.

And Tim doesn’t answer, can’t for the way his breath is literally taken away. His crazily eidetic memory spits out *Damian *when their eyes meet from across the mostly closed shop, Jason and Dick are talking low, glancing at him with flirty, interested smiles, but Damian hasn’t looked away, those green eyes incredibly *intense*.

Like picturing someone with their clothes off, tied to his bed, third orgasm ruined, and the next one carefully planned out for the execution, kind of intense.

Damian licks his lips, making it obvious, while those eyes take a slow sweep down his body, and Tim can’t help the abrupt strike of heat that shivers up his spine.

\*\*

“He is more beautiful in person,” Dick says low in the old language. “Father was right to send us.”

Jason glances at their older brother, sitting back in the rickety chair with deceptive ease, the very picture of *beg me to fuck you*. For the last ten minutes, he’s been picturing that cute little barista panting under him, eyes dazed and desperate in the same breath.

“Kinda begs the question howz he been able ta live with mortals like this. Someone oughta found ‘im out by now.”

Without looking away, catching the curve of cheek go *pink* with his attention, Damian smirks behind his hands. “Father said *twenty-one years*. Perhaps he was be-spelled as an infant. That would explain why he was forced to stay here with mortals rather than live among other halflings sired by Gods.”

And in their world, curses are more common than one would think.

“If the spell had an anchor date, no one would notice him until the duration.”

“’S already hard ta take m’ eye off’n him,” Jay admits low, rumbling deeply in his chest, “gonna be soon if he ain’t already there, ya feel me, boys?”

Dick hums an affirmative, eyes narrow on their prey.

“Should we discuss an actual *plan* to bring him into his power?” Because Damian is already *salivating* for the man moving behind the counter.

Initially, Damian had been against father’s wishes. He was in no way prepared for the first glance in the waters, only slightly less enthralled now that he’s been in the mortal’s presence. His soothing nature, his song-like voice, the pink of his lips, the deep darkness of his eyes, the radiance and calm Damian felt immediately soothes something desperately *angry* that has always animated him as the God of War.

In that moment, *not* having this man is unacceptable. He has every intention of joining Richard and Jason in bed with this *Tim*, aiding them in pleasuring this man over and over and *over*. The need is compounded after facing Tim’s easy smile and soft laughter. Damian finds himself *hungry, *arousal burning him from within, replacing the fire of his rage with something more *primal*. He immediately imagines that softly smiling face to be twisted with unbearable pleasure, bare and beautiful with his thighs over Damian’s shoulders, voice hoarse from moaning, crying, *begging*.

All that in his mind’s eye while watching Tim’s moving mouth, imaging how he would *taste*.

Dick’s mouth quirks when he catches the very intense vibe his youngest brother is setting off, sees their important assignment get adorably flustered. The other mortal behind the counter is talking with flailing hands and easy to read lips, his senses reach out with the wind to catch as much of their conversation as possible, gathering information on their prey.

He smirks when the female mortal seems to be on their side. The hunt won’t be as difficult as he’d first imagined when he had answered their Father’s call.

Jay laughs at their younger brother, “thought that one was obvious from how hard yer cock is in yer pants, Demon.”

The God of War doesn’t bother to look away from their eventual conquest, “*tt. *Crude as usual. Unlike *you*, I do not usually have a taste for mortals. He is the first I’ve come across to elicit this…reaction.”

Dick smirks when the female rightfully compliments his ass, tuning back into the conversation while he subtly watches their assignment come back around the bar and work the machines. He’s already formulating a plan, not counting on their individual power to simply overtake Tim with eye contact. Commands might not work either, but they would need to test it on him to know for sure. Jason’s usual seduction didn’t make Tim speechless with desire, Damian’s intimidating aura didn’t terrorize him or incite him to violence, and Dick’s mostly-feral predator vibe didn’t trigger Tim’s *fight* or *flight*. Come to think of it, their usual effect on mortals didn’t seem to happen to Tim at all.

“Ta be honest…halflings like him,” Jay hitches a thumb in the direction of their prey, “are at least prepared fer what’s ta come, see, ‘cause most halflings are on Paradise Island with the Amazons. Gods n’ Goddesses can find ‘em there, n’ the Amazons keep ‘im all safe. ain’t like that until after a full God brings ‘im ta power. This?” and Jay gives a sweep of one hand to encompass everything, them, the mortal world, the coffee shop. “Well, this ain’t ‘xactly the *precedent*.”

“Surely, since he is still technically mortal, he is...fragile. How can we take him without killing him before his power manifests?”

Dick’s eyes narrow, “simple. He already has an aura of a godling. It’s only getting stronger, and will be more so as long as we are close. By the time he’s ready, he’ll be strong enough to take us.”

“I feel that,” Jason smirks a lil, crossing his ankle over his knee, chair facing toward the pretty thing just waiting fer ‘em. “He’s further along than any I ever felt *not* pantin’ under a God.”

Dami shifts slightly, rolls his shoulders back. “You say this as though he is ...*different*, Jason.”

“Come offa it, Dames. Why else would the big man hisself call alla us fer one halfling, eh? Like that ain’t so far under his *usual*, yeah? I’m thinkin’ this pretty boy might be Daddy’s dirty lil secret.”

Damian straightens, finally taking his eyes off their conquest to glare at his half-brother, “you believe our Father has lain with a mortal and born another child? This man?”

Jay shrugs a careless shoulder, “Only explanation as ta why he asked alla us ta be in on the deal. Way it’s s’pposed ta go, ya only *need* one God ‘er Goddess ta bring a halfling. So, why’s B called in the big guns unless he’s somethin’ *more*? C’mon, Demon. Unique my ass.” His forefinger makes a circle around their table, putting the bigger question out there.

“If he is half blood of our Father,” Dami’s voice goes low and thick, thoughts churning dark behind his eyes, “then taking him to bed–“

Jason laughs out loud again, eyes glittering in the overhead lights, flecks of jade in a sea of blue. “–is gonna be the fuck of yer immortal *life*, Baby. Anyone with ‘im is gonna ride ‘im like an animal ‘till he *screamin’* an’ all that power is gonna fill ‘im right on up like a cup runnin’ over.”

It’s very obvious when Damian’s eyes dilate, slide back to their pending conquest.

Dick looks over at his middle brother with a frown, “don’t count your chickens, Little Wing. The hunt isn’t over.” He turns back to their prey, “we have him in our sites, but we have to actually *catch* him.”

Jason clicks his tongue, “I got it on good authority we can *convince* ‘im. I mean, ya lookit us lately? Mortals are all over me on any standard day.”

And, it’s not a *lie*. Of the three of them, Jason directly interacts with mortals the most. Whether in the Underworld overseeing punishment, or in his high-end nightclub in Los Angeles, Jason lives among mortals with Father’s blessing (as long as the Underworld is kept closed and the guilty submit to justice).

“Well, we gave him a backstory, so the next step is having a den to secure him. Jay, that female mentioned Le Grande. Sound familiar?“

“Oh yeah, it does. No worries, Big Wing, I’m onnit,” and a salacious grin the working barista happens to catch.

While Jason Todd now lives in the City of Angels, Gotham was always his first stomping ground. Whenever he wants a vacation from his nightclub or the hell loop management he’s got going on down below, he comes back to Gotham to live a little in the old *style*. He pulls a phone from his inner jacket pocket, makes a quick call, his voice low and hypnotic, watching as the female puts all their drinks on a small tray for the halfling to carry to them.

He hangs up when the Penthouse is on the way to being prepared, any time Mr. Todd, and a slow smirk slides over his face while he imagines that pretty boy ready ta be *debauched* in all right ways, laid out against blood-red sheet in a very impressive bed, that pink mouth open and panting their names like a *prayer*.

(*Fuck, he’s getting more powerful. We ain’t gonna have much time.* He and Dickie share a side eye while their Dames gets caught further under this boy’s spell. Fer a first mortal, their lil murder muffin picked one hell of a time ta get a *taste*.)

“No worries, boys. Nest is gonna be swanky as fuck ‘cause I got *standards* n’ all.”

“I’m more concerned about whether it’s safe, Jay. I don’t want anyone else finding him for a while, at least not until he is able to go before Father.” Dick subtly watches their prey, keeping tabs on the beauty coming so close to his time. The faint power humming like an aura is a drug to any full God in the area.

“We can make him agreeable enough to keep others from finding him.” Damian waves off, unconcerned. “Once he is fully awakened, his stamina will increase exponentially. Then it is a matter of keeping him in bed long enough to acclimate accordingly.”

“Not if he’s immune to our sway over mortals, Little D.” Dick’s eyes narrow, his gaze turns shrewd, “So we are going to keep him agreeable by being on our *best* behavior and seduce him the right way, slow and gentle until he gives us some indication he can take…more. Everyone understand?”

The scoff from their God of War includes a roll of the eyes because this man is their spoils. Things like *slow* and *gentle* aren’t necessary when you are claiming what you’ve rightfully taken.

Jason, however, smiles wide and white, “ya said the secret word, Dickie.”

(No one has to verify it is indeed *seduce*.)

“Just keep in mind. We’re here to *help him*, not hurt him. The sex is going to be fantastic considering how innocent he looks, but we’re also keeping him *safe*.”

“The only true concern is Chaos. If any of them get a *hint* of him, we will indeed have a battle on our hands,” Damian idly observes, just the thought of what his Chaos Grandfather would do to this beautiful being makes his fists clench, makes fury find root in his heart where the the urge to claim what is his, *theirs*, grows stronger.

Dick immediately straightens, has a second to shutter at the image of Ra’s appearing before this (*their) *mortal and seducing him out of his innocence, Ra’s keeping him chained to a bed with jeweled restraints, Ra’s taking advantage of his power, his body, his very essence.

Dick *seethes *just thinking about it.

“We’ve already found him,” Dick tries to keep his voice steady, eyes all for the boy laughing at the female’s antics, moving around the machinery with knowledgeable hands, “the plan is we keep him secure until he’s stable enough with his power to enter Father’s presence, then they won’t be cause for concern. Chaos cannot enter the Heavens. There, he will be the most safe.”

Jason and Damian both give him their attention.

“C’mon, Dickie,” is smooth in the way Jason can be, their bringer of punishments. “Ya ain’t tellin’ me alls yer thinkin’ ‘bout is keepin’ that lil piece *safe? *Wid’ an ass like that? Getting all pink just talkin’ the talk?*”*

Damian hums softly, “he will be exquisite.”

“Like I already said,” Dick smiles widely when Tim finally picks up the tray with a last few words to his co-worker who is cleaning the machines they just used. “The sex is going to be *fantastic*.”

\*\*

The three hottest men on the planet have unfairly low standards, or he’s being fed a line. Tim can’t really decide which.

Steph was *just* telling him to take them to a hotel in hopes they wanted him to *come up for a drink*.

And that is literally happening here.

Right in his face.

After handing out their drinks, Jason’s low drawl (*and God what that is doing to Tim’s brainpan should be considered a *crime *here*) casually name drops the most expensive hotel in Gotham, just like *so Timmy, we jus’ godda nice room there. It ain’t far, but ya could take us th’ easy way. Maybe come up fer a drink after yer shift?*

*“We would absolutely love to have a drink with you, Tim. A thank-you for staying open long enough to give us a place to orient ourselves in a new city.”*

“*I agree with Richard. We owe you quite a debt, don’t we? It is only polite we…compensate you for the inconvenience, yes?”*

He knows his face is pink with what is absolutely nothing less than an invitation to a *foursome* with three gorgeous men he has a hard time looking away from.

Their eyes feel like hands moving down his body, under his clothes, and in a crazy kind of way, he’s not having paranoid thoughts of kidnapping and human trafficking that could possibly explain why these men wanted ordinary, every-day, boy-next-door *him*.

His hand unconsciously tightens around the tray he’s holding by his side, “I appreciate the offer, but I don’t think this-“ he makes a circular motion with his free hand, “is going to happen. You guys are, ah, a little above my level, and not in a bad way. The flirting is…nice. It’s been a while okay, and I’m weak, but whatever. Anyway, Le Grande isn’t far, so not hard to find, and I’m sure anyone would be *happy* with some of that um…compensation. So, please enjoy your drinks and have a good night,” he gives him his professional, *glad to help you* smile, turns on his heel, and walks away without a backward glance.

(*Even if he’s mentally facepalming himself to Mars* *the whole way*.)

\*\*

Steph is *beyond* disappointed. She’s literally radiating some kind of *what the fuck are you thinking* energy while they finish up with the machines, doors now securely locked, main lights out, and the night is finally *over*.

Their last customers took their drinks with a disappointed air and left not long after his little speech, casting glances at the counter where he was stocking things up while Steph watched them mournfully go.

She had about five minutes of incredulous ire, but he literally lays it out for her.

“What do you think men like that want with someone like me?”

Knowing her, she’d be picturing him naked with a collar around his neck in some rich guy’s mansion somewhere, and she relents a little because yeah, he has a pretty valid point.

The streetlights glow softly in the night as Tim waits while Steph locks the door, and they walk the usual five blocks to her building. Talking about the end of the night is taboo by now, especially when they pass the street leading to Le Grande and just keep walking. They talk about their plans for their next two days off–

(“I have a hot date.”

“Mmhm, Dungeon and Dragons, Tim?”

“What? Hello, D&D was so last year…. It’s Warhammer, actually.”)

– and Steph bemoans his fortune one last time.

(“But like, what *if*\-“

“I don’t think I want to speculate. If I do, then I might realize that was a bonehead move.”

“Aw, Timmy. The next time hot guys flirt, give them the benefit of the doubt. You could have at least said yes to the drink.”

“Well, I *am* twenty-one today.”)

He waves, waits until she’s in the building before moving deeper into the Gotham night. He’s careful about staying in the shadows with his head down to avoid notice. It’s not great here in the Narrows, but he loves his place above the old theatre even if the rent is just *this side* of ridiculous, especially for this part of town.

Still, it’s always a 50/50 walking home.

The several creepy alleyways between the shop and his penthouse could house just about anything, from a robbery to a shooting to kidnapping most nights, and he hunches further in his hoodie, keeps his head low. Against his better judgment, he’s thinking about them instead of the pitiful cupcake waiting in his fridge with a candle on top and ordering a fresh pizza.

He thinks about the humor in Dick’s eyes, and the interest in Jason’s. Not to mention how…*intense* Damian had been. He’s helpless to wonder if those gazes would be the same if they were all in bed together…

His face is suddenly a little hot, and he firmly decides he’s totally allowed to speculate about *what-if* he’d legit said something like, “a drink? That would be really nice actually.”

Yeah, that would have led them to a very nice hotel room with a minibar, and maybe some making out to start.

(He might be sitting on Dick’s lap once he’s had a few drinks in him, getting hotter with each new purposeful brush of hands against him.

Pressed up behind him, Jason would tip his head back for dirty, deep kisses, pulling off his mouth with an audible sound.

*“Yer birthday, izzit? Well, me n’ my boys def’nitely gotch the perfect present f’ ya.”*

*Damian would lean in to talk against his ear, make him shudder in their arms, “It’s easy to unwrap, Timothy. I can promise you would enjoy it.”*

*And if he whines when Dick bites down on his throat, then only the three hottest men he’s ever seen would be able to say for sure.*)

He’s completely into the *what-if* and is probably why his resident-of-Gotham-fight-or-flight instinct doesn’t kick in.

Before the man with the gun ever turns around to face him, Tim can tell he’s dangerous because he’s scared. Desperate and scared are *such* a bad combination.

But even if the man with the gun is desperate, the small family huddled in terror have so more to lose.

Tim's eyes go wide because his night just changed forever, and his automatic reaction is to take a half step forward, to reach out a hand, to a "*don't do this, please don’t do this,*" rolling right out of his mouth.

He’s helplessly looking from the gunmen to the family pinned down in this dirty alleyway leading to his place and the theatre, heart throbbing in fear for the little boy in a nice suit clutching his mother and father with tight fists.

And something in Tim firms, cements, in the immediate, abrupt belief that this is going to end in his favor. Something inherent in him knows he has control of the situation.

The gunman’s barrel is aimed dead center.

(A killing blow.)

"You aren’t going to do this," something in him pushes and pulls, something that makes him so sure, so fucking *sure*, no one in this alley is going to die tonight. (But, his knees still knock with fear and adrenaline while his brain pan works in overdrive.)

A shudder goes through the hand holding the gun, eyes he can't really see in the dark, narrow from below the brim of a dirty hat.

"Get lost, kid.” But the guy plainly swallows, sweat beading off the side of his face, muscles tight with strain. “This isn’t any of your business."

Tim grits his teeth, doesn’t move forward in case he sets something off. "All of us can identify you, and you aren't going to get enough shots off to kill everyone, not without being noticed, even in this neighborhood." His eyes slide back to the family when the motion of the father pulls the small, blue-eyed boy behind them, shielding him.

*You are going to go home tonight, alive and together*, Tim promises the little boy with his eyes. Everything is going to be *fine*.

(And if he could stop it from happening to that little kid with a trembly lower lip and three-piece suit because he got to go with his parents for a night at the movies, then he damn sure isn't going to run.)

"So you?" His own voice goes deep, dark, and from somewhere past all his own fucked-up pain and trauma (his past scars buried in grief and mourning and moving forward because for fuck's sake, there was nothing to go back *to*) . "Aren't going to hurt *anyone*."

“You seem pretty fucking cocky, you little shit.”

“Only because you know I’m right. GCPD always has patrols here, so you won’t get far.”

The gunman sneers, his arm starting to get tired holding up the shiny automatic.

The mother over the gunman’s shoulder has a hand over her mouth, eyes wide and wet, but the small family is subtly shuffling slowly backwards. Tim gets it. He needs to keep the attention on himself, give them time to get out of the line of fire. "The way I see it, you've got two options here."

He slides his wallet out of his back pocket, holds it up over his shoulder between two fingers. "Take this as a door prize and run. Or, try to shoot us, potentially miss because that .38 special is a piece of crap, and have a pretty nice cell at Blackgate for the trouble. Robbery is one thing, but murder? Definitely a whole different type of crime."

The father keeps slowly hedging his family back, trying not to make sudden moves while Tim keeps his wallet waving back and forth, keeps the motion so the gunman stays trained on him.

The tension is palpable while he waits for the gunman’s decision, the next move, the next flinch, the resounding *blam* as the gun goes off, his pulse thudding in the back of his mouth even while he knows everything is going to work out in their favor.

*Take the wallet and run*, he keeps thinking over and over and over. *Don’t look back at them. Take the wallet and *run*.*

A huff in the night between them, and the gun barrel disappears inside a ratty coat, the gunman darting up to snatch the wallet out of Tim’s hand and hightail it the fuck out of the alley.

Once he’s gone and the echoing footsteps fade, the relief is palpable. The father lets out a huge sigh of relief. “Thank-you,” he tells Tim gravely from across the alley. He turns to scoop up the little boy, weave an arm around his wife’s waist, and steer them back toward the theatre and into the light.

Tim, heart thudding in his chest, turns to put his back against the rough brick and mortar. His knees feel weak with relief and adrenaline now that the obvious surge in bravery (reads as *stupidity,* tempting a guy with a gun and all) has left him panting and shaky. “Sure, it’s fine. Being shot in Gotham isn’t really a big deal.”

He’s pretty sure he muttered it to himself because the small family fleeing their almost-demise doesn’t turn. But the voices from the mouth of the alley gasp in outrage.

“What almost happened?!”

Tim jerks because he didn’t think anyone else was behind him when the gunman took off. Imagine his surprise when his customers are standing there staring at him with wide eyes.

“*Shot?*” Jay is already striding forward, hands all over the barista to look for injuries because *dammit*, were they too late and someone already got at him?

Dick has a hand on Damian’s shoulder, pushes the youngest toward the running gunman in an obvious message before joining Jay at their halfling’s side.

He notices how big those blue eyes are with Jay’s long fingered hands pulling and tugging and touching. He catches the pink in Tim’s face when Jay’s hands finally wrap around his hips, thumbs in the niches. Their prey is in their trap now, theirs to reel even closer. All they have to do is keep him cornered and wait for the right moment to strike.

“N-no, nothing, I’m fine, really!” Tim sputters, stepping back out of grabby hands, face hot with how strong Jason’s hands are. “I mean, that’s-that’s pretty standard for Gotham, actually.”

Dick has no qualms palming the side of Tim’s face, tilting his eyes up, using just a bit of influence in his tone when he asks, “still, did he *hurt* you, Tim?”

“No! No, I’m okay. Situation defused. I just had to give him incentive to leave without firing the gun.”

Dick hums, thumb moving over the cut of Tim’s jaw. “He was dangerous. Standing up to him was very *brave*, Tim, but you could have been seriously hurt. I’m a little worried about letting you out of my sight with guys like him running around.”

Jay’s eyebrow arches because *wow, Dickie. ‘At was nice*. But even if he knows the oldest is trying to *push*, trying to make Tim fall under his spell, become more..*open*...to suggestion as Gods have sway over mortals. It takes Jason a second to realize their little mortal ain’t looking all dreamy-eyed n’ dazed with Dickie’s influence.

Means, they’ve godda play this the way Dick said from the beginning. Tricks ain’t gonna make it easy fer any of ‘em.

Not that he’s got a problem chasing when they play *hard-ta-get*.

“I mean, I made it this far in life,” Tim jokes weakly, breath shuddering when Dick’s thumb feathers over his lower lip. “I don’t – why were the three of you passing over this way? I *know* I gave you foolproof directions earlier.”

Instead of answering, Jay wants to give it a go, lets himself pours on the *voice*, “Ya look shakin’ up a lil’ there, Baby. Lookit this,” wrapping his long fingers around one of Tim’s hands, thumb rubbing over the softly beating pulse in his wrist. “Yer hand’s tremblin’. Might wanna come back ta th’ hotel n’ get a drink after all, feel me? Getcha nice n’ calmed down. Ledd’us drop ya off once yer better. Make sure ya don’t run inta no more trouble. ‘Course we want ya ta be *safe* n’ sound, don’t we?”

With the darkness in Jay’s eyes, the possessive hold Dick has on him, Tim can barely swallow, can barely catch a *breath*.

Luckily, his mouth catches up before his brain has time to process the logistics of *where the hell did you come from again?*

“I can’t, sorry. I kind of gave up my wallet when–”

“After what you went through, it’s our treat,” Dick soothes, his other hand itching to touch skin, “consider it a birthday drink.”

The two of them give a more overt *push*.

Tim sucks in a breath to decline, but when Dick takes his hand, the *what-if* in his brain pan flares to life again, and everything feels so much like *fate* or *destiny*. Like he was meant to say yes the first time and here he is getting some kind of divine do-over.

(*Does he even believe in all that shit? Probably not, just his brain trying to help him get laid is more likely the case.*)

Either way, how can he say no a second time?

\*\*

The answer.

He doesn’t.

In less than ten minutes, he’s packed between Dick and Jason in a booth at Le Grande’s very posh digs, a place he’d probably never see in his life considering only the Gotham *elite* had a place in the VIP lounge.

He’s nervously wiping the condensation off his drink, trying not to think of Jason’s massive thigh pressed up against his or Dick’s hand casually on his knee on the other side. Jay has some ridiculously tall beer, and Dick is sipping on a blue drink from a martini glass. Tim has a water with lemon since, you know, his wallet was taken and he literally has no identification to prove he’s of age.

Out of the dim, Damian stalks toward them like a sleek panther stalking prey, those jade eyes zeroing in on their table. With a smirk, he slides into the other side of the booth and holds Tim’s wallet between thumb and forefinger. He places it in front of their...night’s *acquisition*, already eyeing the barista’s soft t-shirt and jeans, calculating how fast they can strip him of the clothes.

Tim’s mouth drops open when he opens his wallet to find money and identification still there, “h-how did you…?”

“I am very persuasive,” Damian purrs over the music, “it is a gift.” He has a moment of satisfaction, recalling the thief’s absolute terror when Damian took on his godly form, full height with spiked armor and flaming sword, glowing green eyes behind his helm, ready to strike the criminal down with one mighty blow.

“*Return the wallet and never seek to harm another soul as long as you remain on this mortal coil.*” Was like ground glass, the flaming blade scant inches from the criminal’s nose.

He didn’t kill the mortal, hadn’t seen the point really.

Tim’s soft smile and awed, “thank-you, Damian.” made dealing with another pesky mortal worth the trouble. “Did you call the police? Turn him in?”

“Unfortunately, he threw your wallet at me and ran. I chose not to follow.” A small lie but Damian will take Timothy’s appreciation nonetheless. “However, I believe he will refrain from petty theft from here on out. You must have made…an impression.”

He gives Jason a side-eye to make sure his brother understood.

Before Tim could ask more questions, Dick winds an arm around his shoulders and cheers. “Great job Baby Bat! You saved Timmy’s wallet!”

“Of course, it was my pleasure to assist our *beloved* barista.”

Tim’s face goes warmer, even without a drink.

“All right,” Jay grins down at their little halfling, “now’s ya can have a drink wid’ us, yeah? Gonna celebrate turning the big two one in *style*, feel me?”

“Don’t worry,” Dick soothes, “we have a place upstairs if we celebrate too hard. Have to warn you, I’m a cuddler *and* I sleep naked.”

Tim doesn’t know if his face can get any more red.

While their little halfling looks about ready ta bust, Jay takes advantage of the distraction, motions to the cocktail waitress making rounds. She scurries right on up to their table, squints at Tim’s ID for a few minutes and then back at him.

Dick orders a round for the table in a tone that is mesmerizing and she assures them she’ll hurry back with their drinks.

Tim only downs three drinks that night, but the soft buzz is nice enough to take the edge off.

He learns Jason manages a nightclub, Damian is a weapons enthusiast, and Dick apparently does some kind of contract work for environmental agencies. All of it is pretty vague and none of them go into detail as to why they’re in Gotham in the first place, or where they’re originally from. Instead, they ask him numerous questions about his life and his job. His parents and family (*all of them long gone. He’s got Steph and Ives now*). Why he stays in one of the most dangerous cities on the planet. You know, understandable questions if not a little *intense*.

While he’s pleasantly sinking into the soft feeling, the three men around him don’t seem to be affected by the alcohol in the slightest but are intently listening to him talk about his life.

(*College was a pipe dream. Right now, he’s just keeping afloat, squirreling away every dollar he can for the inevitable move out of Crime Alley. One day his shitty laptop will be a state of the art system. One day, he’s going to get into social work or something to help other kids like him, so another doesn’t slip through the cracks to live a partial life. *He’s rambling like fuck when he tells them this, keeps going past it without noticing the look passing between the three.)

Their attention is...odd. Nice but odd.

He hasn’t felt important to anyone since Conner broke it off, breaking his heart without trying to hurt him. Theirs was just another tragedy that is his life.

Jay disappears for a moment and brings him water when he declines another drink, not wanting to walk home with stumbles, not after that situation with the gunmen could have ended horribly–

The night changes when he admits he’s never seen a room in Le Grande, never been through the doors before tonight no matter how long he’s lived in Gotham, and accepts the invite up to see the penthouse. All of it happening so easily is terribly close to what he’d imagined in his secret fantasy, that his tongue doesn’t know how to say anything other than *yes*.

\*\*

“Come, Beautiful One,” Dick croons, pulling Tim in the elevator by the hand.

It’s nice when there’s no pretense at all, and Dick braces him, back-to-chest, hands on his hips while Jay tilts his face up enough to kiss him first.

The sensation of the elevator rising makes his stomach drop, or that might be Jay sliding his tongue in Tim’s mouth while Dami’s hand makes it under his shirt and Dick leans down to latch on to the side of his throat.

There’s so many hands all over him, touching, holding, exploring, that all he can do is grip Jason’s shirt and Damian’s forearm.

He gets a brief respite when the elevator doors *ding* softly, and he’s surrounded by these absolutely *beautiful* men walking him through a lavish entertaining room with a long bar, piano, and leather furniture. The crimsons and golds highlight the night spilling in through the windows.

Soft words in his ears keep him from rambling on how amazing all of it looks.

“Gonna take care a’ ya right nice, Sweets. Promise ya ‘at.”

His hoodie is suddenly gone, and hands over his shirt grip and pull while they trade off, moving around him.

“I can’t believe you’re going to let us have you. Timmy, you’re so hot like this.” And that’s a wet stripe up his jugular, making him gasp in someone’s mouth.

“Thank the Fates, Beloved. I am almost at the end of my *leash*.” Before Dami pushes Dick away and takes the mortal’s mouth for himself.

“I hear ya, Baby Bat. He’s so fuckin’ pretty. Gonna look even better all hard n’ pink n’ wet fer us, ain’t he?” Jason’s hand slides down, *down* over the crotch of Tim’s jeans, making his hips judder forward.<br>

Dick slides behind him, palms under his work shirt, and his back arches against it. “You’re not making it any easier to get him in bed, you know. This place is ridiculous.”

“Yeah? If ya had yer say, ya’d wanna just lay ‘em down in some field n’ have ‘im unner th’ stars ‘er some shit. That ain’t good ‘nuff for our boy here.”

“Agreed. He deserves to be worshiped *lavishly*.” Damian finally pulls back when Dick is pulling the shirt up over their prey’s chest from behind, those violet eyes disappearing long enough to widen when his upper body is bare for their hands. “Even *this* is not sufficient.”

And he leans down to run his mouth over the jut of collar bone for Dick to turn Tim’s head again and have another turn.

“Have some *respect*, asshole. These are pretty swanky digs, but we can skip the tour f’ now since we all seem ready ta give our boy here one helluva birthday present, yeah?”

Damian grins darkly, shoves at Dick’s shoulder to pull him off Tim’s mouth, “we certainly want to make sure he has the right place to *enjoy* his presents, don’t we?”

And Dami literally picks Tim up under the thighs, starts carrying him through the massive room without even appearing winded.

(*And no, he’s not imagining Damian holding him up just like this, fucking him against the wall like he weighs nothing, calling him *Beloved*, telling him how good he feels...*)

In his entire life, Tim never thought he’d get to see an honest-to-God orgy bed.

Apparently, he gets a host of new experiences tonight.

The bed is bigger than two people realistically need and probably bigger than the four of them need. He makes a soft noise when Dick literally takes him from Dami’s arms, knee walks them to the center before dropping Tim down on obscenely fluffy pillows and soft, silky sheets.

“There, that’s better. Why don’t we get you comfortable, Timmy?” Dick tilts his chin down, eyes calculating now that they’ve cornered their prey. His hands are already working the dark jeans down over the cut of hip bones and thighs, lifting the mortal up with the barest of touches, watching the pink start spreading from Tim’s face down to his chest, hair spread around him, and those eyes half-mast.

Jason and Damian are shedding clothes, eyes all for him and Dick on the bed.

Damian’s eyes narrow when he’s down to briefs, a knee up to start moving toward their intended target, but Jay’s big hand on his shoulder stops him.

The marks, usually hidden from mortal eyes, briefly flare along Damian’s arms, shoulders, torso, and legs. The ancient language flaring along his skin establishes his place in the world of the Gods, as one of the greatest warriors.

His eyes are narrow in suspicion, staring down at the back of his hands when the jade coloring flashes again, and arches a brow at Jason in question.

No words are needed when Jay’s eyes go to the halfling on his bed, attention kept by Dickie sucking his bare skin, sliding a hand into their mortal’s boxers, drawing another noise out of him.

Comprehension dawns when Timmy arches under Dick. This halfling is calling to the power in them when he shouldn’t be able to do so, not until they bring him fully into his power. By the flash of blue on the back of Dick’s arms, hand obscured by Timmy’s boxers, and the flare of red on Jason’s chest, they need to rein themselves in until he gets ready ta *ascend*.

Damian and Jay breathe, gather their control, make the flare of their godly markings fade before their halfling catches it and they have no way to explain. They just have to keep him too busy to notice the little things, don’t they?

Deep breath, and both of them *move*.

Damian subtly nudges Dick aside to take over sucking marks down their mortal’s chest. Dick gives a mere glance down and he gets the look Jay gives him over Dami’s bare back.

Luckily for them, it’s relatively *easy* to keep their mortal’s attention exactly where they want it.

Flipping him on all fours gives Tim soft sheets to bury his burning face while hands work up his back, make his spine arch up under the touch. More hands up the back of his thighs, squeezing the muscle before moving *up* to cup his balls and tug.

Dick laughs a little and pulls him up by the shoulders to get under him, to lick at the vein in his hard cock, turn so Tim can flop back down on his hands, and rub his cheek against Dick’s hip bones and move closer to lick pre-cum pooling around the head.

Dami lifts him up to shove his tongue in Tim’s mouth at the same time Jason bites his ass cheek, opens him with both thumbs–

And dives in tongue first.

He’s bent at an odd angle, Dick’s big hands on his hips, holding him in place to be licked and sucked, nibbles along the length of him, making his thighs tremble in Jason’s palms helping hold him up and open.

He whines in Damian’s mouth, eaten at both ends, and the tension in his belly is building, his hands clenching in Damian’s thick hair.

“*Beautiful*,” and Tim knows he’s imagining how brightly those green eyes glow at him red-faced and panting. “So beautiful like this, aren’t you, Beloved?”

He just closes his eyes and trembles when Dick takes the tip in his warm mouth.

“Best...birthday...*ever*,” he groans, giving a small *eep* when Damian laughs at him, palms the back of his neck and pushes him back down, now facing both of their cocks bobbing in front of his face.

He latches on to Dick first, wrapping a hand around Damian, thumbing the proud curve, loosely jerking him off while trying to remember how to control his gag reflex.

And Jay doesn’t lift his face from what he’s doing to this *perfect* lil’ piece, just holds up his hand long enough to snap his fingers. The pocket of his pants twitch and a golden ring floats up in the air, landing daintily in his palm.

The ring is passed to Dick and slid under his teeth while he leers up the tense muscles of their prey, listening to the wet sounds of Dami taking a turn sliding in and out of that pink mouth.

He feels the jerk of Tim’s hips, has to remember not to grip *too* hard to keep their prey in place, for him to take Tim as deeply as possible so the ring can be snug around the base of him, keeping him from coming until the time is just *right*.

The magic flares softly and Dami pulls out of Tim’s mouth in time to hear the hoarse cry when the base of his dick is restricted.

“Fuck! Wh-what are you doing to me?!”

Jason rises up, smacking his lips, eyes half-mast, the green flecks brighter against the dark blue. “Sshh, s’all right baby. Just wanna make sure we getcha nice n’ worked up fer it, yeah?”

Two fingers play along his wet entrance, slide down to rub his tingling balls, and back up, press against him, so close to sliding in.

“W-Wait,” he gasps over his shoulder, “I-I haven’t in a long time–”

Jay slides his other hand up from the back of that thigh to rub circles on Timmy’s ass instead, rocking the tips of his fingers in and out.

“Ya ain’t godda worry, Sweetheart. We’re gonna take *good* fuckin’ care a’ ya, yeah? Gonna make sure it don’t hurt at *all*. Gonna make sure yer nice n’ ready ta take it. All’s yer gonna feel is how *good* it is ta be fulla me, fulla Dick, fulla Dames. An’ once we all had our fill a’ ya, then we’re gonna make ya come *screamin’*.”

“Oh...Oh my *God*.”

Well, ain’t it the truth?

He knows him n’ Dickie n’ Dames gedda laugh about that right there, every time Timmy moans it out.

(*Gods right here ‘fore ya, Sweets. Get it up close n’ personal.*)

He breathes out slowly, the marks on him, the crimson markings on his hands, flares briefly *Holy Power Number #7, Pleasure Over Pain*.

The one power he has that’s worth a’ shit when it comes ta mortals what get tangled in his sheets. The one that kills any pain, the one that allows him to give immediate pleasure in a single touch.

S’ also a nice *tease* fer the damned souls he has ta manage. Another way ta torture ‘em after they live through their own personal hell loop over n’ over. Give ‘im one respite, one moment of feelin’ something other than their own guilt and shame ‘fore he sends ‘im back.

When his fingers slide in, start opening their boy on *up*, he gets not even a squeak or flinch of discomfort, not when he finds Timmy’s sweet spot on the first try.

(*Not that the kid could prolly feel anythin’ with Dickie and Dames keepin’ him the right kind of occupied.)*

But he’s in and seeking that perfect spot, satisfied their mortal ain’t gonna feel nothin’ but *nice* tomorrow morning. Hips jutter into Dick’s mouth when Jay finds it, pressing up and wiggling his fingers just right. Timmy can’t even see the mark lighting up his wrist and hand, disappearing inside that beautiful ass with his fingers, that’s a sight only for Jason’s hungry eyes.

Dami winds a hand in his hair, tilting his face up to see those eyes fall half mast, hear the soft noises coming out of his mouth.

“Me first, Beloved. Then Jason, and Richard for last, yes? Then you’re going to come for us. Until then, we shall use you however we desire. Do you agree to this?”

Tim gasps, eyes widen when he thinks something on Dami’s face flashes green for an instant, but a blink and it’s gone, a figment of his overactive imagination.

(*Right?*)

Dick swallows around him, wet and tight, and Tim’s eyes roll back, mouth falling open to whine, and his body is going haywire, the electric shock from his ass and cock lighting up his spine, bringing tears to the corner of his eyes.

A jarring slap to his ass with Jay’s free hand shoves him further, his cock sinking the last few previous inches into Dick’s warm mouth, teeth bumping against the restrictive ring.

“Godda answer ‘im, Baby. Godda tell us we can *have* ya, see?”

“Wh-what? I-I...*please, please –”*

“Tell us, Timothy.” Dami slides a hand under his chin, both hands gripping him, keeping his attention on those glittering green eyes.

Dick, Damian, and Jay tense for a brief moment, hands tightening down on him, the half-finished magical press in the air against their back. The covenant with him they’re making, one in which he has to acquiesce if they are to bring him at least partially into their world.

“R-Red. Red is my safeword,” he gasps out, unconsciously moving his hips back into Jay’s fingers, trying to get that pressure back.

And the air in the room *eases*. The admission is agreement enough for them to be able to bring him into his power, to build him up until he explodes with it. For his pending magic to accept them.

All at once, he’s thrown onto his back, and the switcheroo is Damian knee walking up the bed, his mouth twisted in an impossibly sexy *smirk*.

“Thank *fuck*,” Jason crawls up to lick over pert nipples, use a lil’ *teeth*.

But damn ain’t their halfling pretty when Dami grips him under the knees and pulls him right down, rubs across that tight lil’ hole.

He watches that expression, jus’ like Dick and Dami, makes sure he can take that thick cock without even a flinch.

“Relax for me, Beloved, allow me to have you,” and he looks up, catches those jade eyes, can’t look away to save his own life. Even with Jason and Dick on either side of him, loosening his fists from the death grip he’s got on the sheets.

The first push isn’t the initial awkward, slightly painful stretch he’s used to feeling. It isn’t anything like that at all.

Jason grins across their halfling’s chest at Dick’s bright blue eyes and matching smirk. They take in how that mouth falls open, how those eyes go half-mast, and the long, long sigh that ends in just the right kind of needy whimper.

Dami throws his head back, bites down on his lower lip and how *incredible* this mortal feels around him, absently rubs one hand over Tim’s lower abdomen as he bottoms out.

“Perfect for me,” Dami bites out, eyes glittering.

“Oh, *oh*,” Tim pants and arches, the spot inside him shooting pleasure up his spine. His eyes flutter with how *full* and *good* and *how is this even possible?* flits through his brainpan. It’s literally been *months* since he’s had penetrative sex, and it’s so good, so amazing, he can’t even *think* of anything other than his own orgasm.

Dick and Jay reach down to help, sliding forearms under his knees to hold him open for Dami to ease back, to push in with eyes all for that pink-face and bright eyes.

The language of the Gods spills out of his mouth, how beautiful Tim is, how well Tim takes him, how good his body feels, how he should always give himself to them. His eyes only go to his brothers holding this halfling open for him when Tim is writhing in their grip, when the sound of his hips slapping against Tim’s ass is faster and louder, when he is getting close, when he can feel the heat, the pressure, the warmth of power rising in the body below.

“Yes,” Damian hisses, one hand on Tim’s abdomen just above his straining cock, “so perfect, so ripe and ready for us.”

Only Jason and Dick know what he really meant, the two of them keeping their halfling’s attention away from the soft glow of the youngest God’s hand.

“Please, *please*,” Tim’s brain misfires, big hands holding him up and open, his spot hit over and over, the tension in his stomach under Damian’s hand winding tighter, almost *unbearable*. It’s heat and pressure, his fingers and toes tingling, something *bigger*, more intense than anything he’s experienced before.

Something something

The pressure in his belly tightens when Dami finally comes, bruises him with a tight grip, and thrusts *deep*. A low throb of thigh-shaking pleasure rocks through his abdomen when he feels *warm* and *wet*, and he’s so so close his toes fucking *curl*. And he could scream how it feels like the man over him just keeps coming and coming, filling his belly Tim' glances down a little fearfully to see if his stomach is distended from how much –

(*The dry spell must have turned his brain into mush because there’s no way. No way another guy can-can breed him full enough to actually ***show*****, right?*****)**

The ring keeps him from finishing, no matter how close he is or how incredible it feels to be *this full*.

(*If he was anywhere near his right mind, red flags would be all over the place because he’s never, ever had sex this amazing without an orgasm.*)

Those green eyes lock on him, shoulders and biceps flexing as he leans over to press a firm kiss to Tim’s mouth. He makes it softer than expected, mapping out Tim’s mouth in possession, one hand holding him still to take it.

“Thank-you, Beloved. You are perfectly *exquisite*.” Dami smirks in satisfaction when Tim just flops his head over bonelessly, whimpering softly as Dami gently pulls out.

He’s a mess when Jason hefts Dami out of the way and pulls Tim up to straddle his lap. “‘Ere we go, Baby. C’mere n’ give us a ride, yeah?”

He can’t help but feel a moment of pity for the poor mortal, all cute n’ shit with his red face and equally red cock all bound up, letting the pressure build, letting each a’ ‘em fill him with their own magic ‘til he can’t hold it no more. The scent of him is getting stronger, the barely-there aura of power strengthening, would be something almost tangible by the time Dickie gets to him, something they could sink their *teeth *inta.

An’ ‘cause he’s a good one, Jason makes their mortal look him in the eye when he fits in right nice and *pulls*.
