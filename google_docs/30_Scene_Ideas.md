# 30 Scene Ideas

*Note:* When I started this, I never thought anyone would read it. I’ve said it before. When I started reading in the Batfam fandom, I could barely find any Tim Drake-centric, kick ass detective stories, and like I’ve also said, I decided to write one. You ah, you all know that part.

So, what you might not know is how I planned to make this thing like just the first chapter. I might have drabbled with 2,3, and 4, but they were never going to go anywhere. None of it was. It was a little fucking around to make me feel better about someone recognizing how much this guy got fucked over by DC comics. It was all about giving my fave character in all of comics his motherfucking DUE. That’s what it was.

Over 26,000 hits. Almost 1,000 kudos. Over 300,000 words.

That? Was never in my brain pan when it started.

Getting to Chapter 30 was also never in my brain pan, but yet, here we are. And eventually, I’m going to wrap this thing up, put a bow on it, and use it as my jumping off point to tell DC they can kiss my ass.

*Time….*

It all boils down to *time*.

\*\*

(Remember some flashback you wanted here. Something from the Metakiller maybe?)

\*\*

\*\*

*Now*

He brings himself back to the situation at hand because things like “*Don’t. Run.”* are still sitting crazily in his brain pan.

(Which really shows how *hard* that hit him because it’s a little closer to his consciousness than the usual array of plans going down right now.)

Perched on the back of Hood’s ride after a pretty rocking night of a little detecting going down–with the *Bats* even (*Dick was going to kiss you. Seriously, don’t kid yourself)*– to make everything a little *spicy*, he’s gripping the seat while his cape flies behind him and the wind is tearing through his hair. He might still be on edge from the (*almost*) explosion they narrowly managed to escape.

(*It’s nice *not* to get blown up for once*–*there, that’s not an awkward thought*.)

The staying power of the suit B made for him is apparently made with such things in mind since he’s not sporting anymore *owfuck* than he was before with healing shrapnel and bullet wounds. The body armor is actually doing a *righteous* job of keeping pressure in the right places so the muscle movement isn’t nearly as painful as it would be in his other suit. He would need to have B lay out the composition for him sometime because he could really get used to a suit like *this,* thank-you very much.

A gloved hand reaches back to grip on the side of his thigh, anchoring him to the bike as they tilt to the right when the curve is sharp and his own ride can’t be *too* much farther down the road. Besides, Hood normally does that, grips the leg of his passenger if the turn gets sharp. Roy, Dami, Dick, Cass, Steph, him, even *B* on the *Surprise, Batman!* occasions. It’s a *thing* he does with virtually *everyone*.

(*He’s not letting go.*)

It still makes Red’s already confused and painfully alert senses go a *little* off-kilter. (*Those eyes when the bathroom door opened.*)

Squashing all of it down, staying in *Red* mode is proving to be the struggle of his career because *really*.

(There might be some attraction there. There *might* be some tension*,* but dammit, *dammit*, it doesn’t *mean* anything, it *can’t.*)

(...Can it?)

The woods get familiar under the cut of Hood’s headlamp, breaking his thoughts from the embarrassing *dilemma*.

(*Get back in the game. Terrible baddies, shipments of who fucking ****knows**** what on the way, and the evidence stacking up that he’s going to be face those ass hats who put ****feeling**** into their torture techniques.*)

With his thoughts coming back around to the pending show-down, Red climbs off behind Hood to get to his own Ducati, and the taller vigilante automatically reaches out to grip his forearm to steady him since, you know, slightly injured and such. And it’s completely *stupid* how his mouth drops open to just, you know, *throw it out there* between them. *I think Dick almost kissed me and it’s time for you guys to stop whatever and the fuck this ****is****. We can’t do this to each other.*

Because it’s getting to a dangerous point, a place where one of them is going to step over some kind of imaginary *line* with him...and it’s going to do what he was pretty terrified of, breaking their relationship. He can *see* it happening. If Dick had actually closed the space between them, if Jay actually *saw* the almost-not-really-yes-maybe kiss, the effect, the possible ass-kicking aside, he’d be breaking them up and that is… unacceptable.

*Hell no*.

Which means he has to be the ass-hat that has to actually *say something*, “after this is all done and over with. We need to have a *talk*, Jay. You, me, and Dick.”

The helmet moves in his direction, the whiteouts following his progress to his own bike because, well, *real names while in the mask* is one of their strictest *no-no* rules. And as much as he wants to swallow it down, laugh it off at the last second–

He *can’t*.

(*Not like it’s really going to change how he feels or anything, right? Jay tried to kill him and Dick kicked him out of the family and still those stupid feelings are just...*there. And Red–*Tim*– is getting close to the edge of *sanity* because he can't be in denial anymore. Can't deflect, cant pass it *off*. Not with everything that’s happened in the last 24 hours in Gotham, in the Cave, in the Manor.*)*

“Wanna have a *talk, *Timmy?” Hood follows along with the name game, and even with the synths, the tone of voice is *off* somehow from the usual old Gotham drawl, “sounds like ya got something ta *say*.”

“Yeah,” keeping his back to Hood’s whiteouts, Red pulls his helmet out of the memorable mushroom-shaped bush. “I think I’ve got something to say that we all should hear.”

“S’alright. Meet’cha back at the Cave and we’ll have a lil’ *talk*, Timmers–”

“It can wait until after all the sleuthing going down. Besides, I’m going back to my Perch, but we can Skype it out when it’s all said and done–” and he’s *really* not a coward. *Nope*, but just the talk itself is going to be difficult. It’ll work a little easier if he’s at his nest while the Bats are coordinating with their own info.

“Nuh-uh,” Hood waves a finger back-and-forth, “B’s gotta sweet lil *surprise* he picked up from our *buddy, *Shaw. Seems like that motherfucker knew how to get to the tech they wanted him ta program. Sounds ‘bout right up yer alley.”

Which just *shows* how well Hood knows him because tech could give him more to go on, another spot of evidence in this very quickly widening gyre of bad guys and terrible things happening.

*Shit. He is figuratively ****boned***.

(Wouldn’t it be nice to be legitimately–?)

“Then what I’ve got to say will wait until after we blow this case open,” he sneers, pointedly going to his wrist computer just to look *busy*, giving him something to look at other than Hood. The distraction completely helps him pretend the *UST* isn’t even *there*.

“Mmhm. Maybe it will...n’ maybe it *won’t*, Baby Bird,” and it sounds sounds softer coming through the synths, drawing Red’s gaze back to Hood’s loveable ass.

(*“You were ****my**** Robin.” *)

“We don’t need distractions,” he comes back, easing up a little to try and play *witty banter*, “we need someone to pick-up Dick’s stupid ass before he gets taken off the street again. Are you on that?”

He know he’s in trouble, *knows* something about the jig being *up* when Hood kicks the stand down and leans the bike on it, crosses his arms over his chest, and those whiteouts in the helmet are pointed right at him.

“Could be, Timmy. But if you n’ Dickie weren’t quite *done* wit’ yer conversation by the time I rolled up, ya could go on an’ pick ‘em up.”

“We-we just got blown up a little,” and *no no*, he’s already got his helmet on so there’s no *way* Jason can see how hot his face is without some kind of X-ray vision.

(*Thank ****fuck***)

The noise coming from Hood is something all too *knowing*, making his stomach drop just a little.

As usual, however, Red Robin is the master of distraction and *dammit* if he won’t earn the title.

“Wouldn’ta thought that was the *sitch* when I rolled up on ya*,* Baby Bird. Seemed ta me like the two a’ ya were nice and *comfy* there.”

If this section is to continue, this could be Tim on the bike when they part and he is thinking about how he has to detach himself from them more, because it's getting crazy dangerous how much he is towing the line and he doesn't want to be the one that fucks shit up for them because they have something good going. But they are tempting and he has to put some space between them - Linking to the scene below when Tim trying to go for a shower and putting space between em?

\*\*

In the Watchtower, Caro screams out abruptly at the massive wracking *pain* taking over her senses.It’s a wave over her mind, a wave cresting, crashing, aching, burning, running, working, *trying so hard to make it all right when it’s always been wrong and it’s time, it’s time, it’s ****time***, and flowing back out and away.

*Time*, she thinks woozily when her knees go out and Karm, Charlie, and Leo crowd around her talking too fast, too loud, too *much*.

The feel across her aching mind, a red *hot* burning that is *so* familiar, so much that tears sliding down her face and into Charlie’s hair aren’t because of hurts. She’s had too many hurts for just *that* to make her cry.

No, it’s because she *knows* who it is in her mind, who’s running through that fast to be

Gone

The next second.

Her chest hitches with a half-sob while Karmen yells into the ceiling’s intercom for Mr. J’onn, for him to come **right now**.

Leo is kissing her forehead softly, gently, looking in her eyes, but he’s too fuzzy and the tears are making her nose clog, but she can’t stop.

She can’t stop. She can’t stop. She can’t stop.

*They’re running out of time*.

\*\*

\*\*

Bats having a convo about the damn WETMS and all the references coming up and putting together the baddies are the Triad. I could see Dami coming to B first and laying it down, so when Tim, Jay, and Dick come in from their night of sleuthing, B is just waiting on him.

## The Cave

\*\* (*Dick had begun to suspect as well from Ch 28 since the Triad was supplying baddies on the low like Vandal Savage and Slade Wilson. *Robin also figured it out in Ch 28. Dick might get a little pissed when he realizes Tim already knew the Triad might still be operating because he didn’t bother to mention it to them :D*)*

B has his workout clothes on, and the logo on the big computer makes Tim’s mouth go instantly dry.

Well, *Fuck* would just about cover it.

“You must have forgotten to mention something,” B starts casually, *cooly*, “I thought I would give you the opportunity to tell us about it instead of jumping to conclusions.”

A litany of things go through his brain to somehow divert this, but well, the World’s Greatest Detective is five steps ahead of him (*someone had enough time to hack the computer in the repurposed BatPlane, dammit*), and there’s only so much his bullshit tech can stand up to when he’s got things like, you know, *Batman* cracking his systems.

Not to mention the Wayne Enterprises stamped box sitting right on the computer console, the one he obviously took from Shaw.

You know, the one with his trackers from WETMS just *sitting right there*.

(*It’s really all the evidence they need, isn’t it?*)

Slowly, like one of those horror movie moments, Jay, Dick, Dami, Cass, and Steph stare at the computer with the lines of coordinates (*the same encoded ones from those special deliveries he’s been tracking*), go to the tracker between B’s thumb and forefinger, and come right back to *him*.

“I can definitely explain,” falls out of his mouth while his pulse picks up and it’s a fight not to fidget like he was still *that* Robin just trying to keep B from getting mad when he found out how bad the night had really *been*.

“Oh?” Because Jay is arching a brow with a decidedly obvious frown, “ ‘cause this looks a *helluva lot* like those sons of fucking *bitches* ya danced with last year, Timmy. Even have yer tech from that time, yeah?”

And yes, yes he *knows* it’s his fuck-up, Jay. Fully fucking aware here.

The snap-back, the *this is mine, not yours* justification, that *yes*, he fully intends to handle it, but at this juncture, all the Bats could recognize the ticks, the barely noticable flinch in his squared shoulders, knows *now* how they need to *handle* it.

“I’m going to take a leap here,” B starts out slowly, staring down Tim’s very, *very* still figure, “and say you were eventually going to tell us about this.”

Around him, the others are giving him the proverbial *stink-eye*.

His hands tighten while he stares up into the still motion image on the screen of the big computer. If there was ever a time to facepalm, that moment would be now. “Do I need to mention this really isn’t your problem?”

“You should have told us,” Dick cuts him right off at the *knees*, “the *second* you suspected it was the White Triad behind all this, you should have *said so*, Timmy. Dammit, I thought we were *past this*.”

And now they strategically start to close in on him, keep him from taking off, from taking the responsibility of it all on his shoulders and leaving them in the dust (even though he still has a *plan*). Dami is the first to ease forward while Tim’s eyes are on B, then Jay when Dick starts up.

“I didn’t have enough evidence to prove it, Dick,” he finally gets in, “I needed to--” but unfortunately for *him*, everyone realizes where this is going to *go*. As in, Red will claim to need time in his Perch to gather together the necessaries and probably vanish rather than put the Batfam into the path of his own international terrorists.

“The most effective way to divert us is to use the word *evidence*,” is Dami, his expression twisted in something slightly *familiar* in that *stabbing is just about 50/50* category. “It will not work, Tim.”

Bruce, however, is the one that usually has little problem cutting through the bullshit, and since plan *Get Tim Back to the Bats* had figured out just how ineffective retreating when it comes to Tim and his terrible *tendencies* has come to be

“Whether or not you had anything definitive is moot. Your suspicions are on point enough that you should have let us know even without the numbers.” B just stares him down because *yup*, he’s been caught.

“The White Triad isn’t a Bat priority,” he makes it quiet, makes it take *root*. “It’s *mine*, and since I was the one that took them down last time, it’s my responsibility if they’ve come back bigger and more bad ass than ever.” He turns just enough to be looking at Bruce, “this *isn’t* your fight.”

“The point of this, Tim,” B stresses, “is that it’s *your* fight and dammit why *wouldn’t* we want to be there? Why wouldn’t we want to have your back in this?”

“*Because it’s my fucking responsibility,” *since that much isn’t obvious apparently, “It’s *my fuck-up*. I’m the one that needs to *fix-it*.”

\*\*

When the alarm on his wrist computer goes off, and the alert if very WE sensitive, it’s *Go Time*.

\-It’s Tam again, the email about the premiers Gala to raise money for the Wayne Foundation for the Sciences, one of his pet projects. He was there last year and the year before, was expected to be there this year, Tim, don’t skip out on her, and--

He reads that line over again, *he was expected to attend*.

The light bulb goes off because now he has a plan.

“The original WETMS is on an external hard drive. I *can’t* access it from here.” He talks while throwing on a hoody, the daytime pseud. “My special *delivery* is happening tonight, so I *have* to be ready for it.”

“Ain’t going alone, you feel me?”

“For now, *yes*, I am. I have to do the coordination, and you two can meet me at nightfall so we can go down to Dixon Dock and unwrap our little *package*.”

But his eyes slide subtly over to Dick’s and (*“Don’t. Run.”*) quickly averts before his face starts to heat up again.

\*\*

*The missing part after they find the nice intel*

\*\*

It’s late afternoon.

\*Jay has scanned the incoming ships (in 29), he’s got the code. The same one they got from the ghost drive, bringing it up on the screen of the Batcomputer

\*Dami bringing the system--the trackers were never recovered, that’s what he found out in WE’s system.

\*Dick: (what did he get from his little span of “captivity”)

All of it bringing the case together, it’s the White Triad. But even *more*, it’s finding out the group had expanded, was feeding, making everything possible.

\*\*

Also in the Watchtower, Karm comes back. “Something about time anomolies and someone called the Architect?”

(Then MENTOR LOVE: while Tim is in the Cave and Clark is sitting beside Kon in the Tower all worried and attentive--he and Di totally bring food for the kids, just pizza everywhere. But Tim’s disembodied voice observes, “some exposure to the sun couldn’t hurt if you’re still feeling the drain.” “Magic always does it to me,” Clark confides with a shrug. “No one is 100% invulnerable anyway.” and those two just take off the sun for a hot minute, lol)

\*\*

\*Leosworld making references to Tim running:

(B diverts him from going to the Perch immediately after saving Dick, Tim has a flashback thought of how the bomb went off and what deets he might have gotten from the van) So he IS in the Cave, and then there’s the thing from the Ch29 notes about the Bats finding out it IS the Triad he’s after. They give all the proof from above. And Tim just gets all tight and unstable, his voice wobbly while he finally adds:

“Th-there’s also a code. The code is…” (Get this from ch27 or 28, the one before Pain), so he’s throwing down all his own evidence.

GIve the Bats a moment with him so he can realize it’s not just on his plate now, it’s on THEIR plate. They’ve been running alongside him the whole time without him even noticing. And he might blink rapidly, he might try to step away from it, be angry because *it’s his fuck-up*, and the Bats getting pissed right back because they’re all in the vigilante game together and DAMMIT, they’re going to help him.

\*Once it’s established Tim is going to let them help (and maybe B is going to volunteer to check the crates, and maybe discussion of how he needs a little time off to attend the mentioned gala (where he knows more than he’s saying)\*

\*But once B and Dami and Alfred are running upstairs, Dick and Jason have their own moments to bracket him in:

He watches B and Dami disappear up the stairs for bedtime and sits back down at his workbench with the undersuit halfway down his body, elbows on the top to hold his face in his hands and just *breathe* a moment.

He doesn’t realize how long he’s been sitting there until it’s Dick’s hand on his shoulder and “--mmy?”

Dick and Jason have finished their post-mission clean-up, showered and smelling like *awesome*, enough that Tim’s tongue gets tied because he *really* didn’t mean to be down here long enough to be left alone with both of them. He even gets quickly to his feet, any excuse to move *away*, something about needing a shower himself because God he can’t even *look* at either of them (biology and adrenaline: those are the reasons they got so close, that he could have thought maybe--)

But Dick has him by both biceps, stopping the whole *run* mentality. His eyes are clear like glass, and maybe Tim just *imagined* the heat and darkness in them--

“Hey,” and it’s soothing, easy, “you’re okay. I know this has to be messing with you, but we’ve got your back, Timmy. You aren’t going after them alone this time, okay?”

He just blinks because *that* wasn’t what he expected. Maybe ‘stay the hell away from my boyfriend Tim’ or a gentle reminder that he and Jason are an item and anything that happened before was misconstrued.

Nothing like that happens, nothing like that happens *at all*.

“It’s fine,” he starts hesitantly, pulling back just slightly, eyes darting away, “I mean, we’re Bats, we’ve got this, and--and I really should get back to the Perch so I can get the deets B needs. I mean, I’m on my way out of here--” he makes another small step back, looking over Dick’s shoulder--

And bumps into Jason’s chest because the guy is just pulling out all his Bat-knowhow (and it’s telling how distracted he is by Dick’s aura and touch that he hadn’t noticed Hood sneaking up behind him). He completely doesn’t fold when Jason just steps in, pushing him between them, trapping him right where he shouldn’t *be*.

His eyes go wide when Jay slides a hand around the bare skin above where his the undersuit clings to his hips (because Alfred had shoved the suit down to check his bandages earlier and Tim just didn’t pull it up).

“Yeah,” Jay is leaning down, his nose just barely against the knob of bone at the base of Tim’s neck, making those eyes get *huge*. “Gotta start digging inta yer own search, right Timmy?”

“Yup,” he tries, but *fuck*, he really can’t breathe.

Jay hums against the back of his neck and Tim shudders all the way down, his eyes falling half-mast, giving Dick the proof he also *needs* (and maybe that mention while the two former Robins are showering? That they need one more bit of proof?)

Tim just sucks in a breath, his brain coming back on line because *you asshole, they think you’re freaked the ****fuck**** out by the Triad* and of-fucking-course they would think so.

So they’re being *nice* like they have been for months.

Depends on whether this is the smut bit - but i can totally see them about to kiss him and damian comes thundering down the steps, interrupting them and tim makes a break for it, goes back to his perch (like it says below) and D n J follow him there and have a heated evening?

Holy shit!!

\*\*

The cut-and-crime-fighting: B goes to the WatchTower (12 hours), Robin to the Tower (24), and Red to his Perch.

SMUT

\*\*

When the Batman calls, that means *shit is getting real*.

B’s face is utterly super serious and KF straightens automatically. He has an immediate feeling churning in the lower part of his stomach.

The Batman finally found something.

Which explains why Wally is at his back and Barry staring B down from behind the cowl of the Reverse Flash costume.

“I’ve run the algorithms,” B is saying with the usual amount of *gloom* and *doom* when it comes to time fuckery. “A residue of sorts has been left in the time stream, marking each event that’s been touched by the same technology.”

“And we’ve got to go back and set it right before the dominoes start to fall,” Barry starts slowly, fingers twitching against his sides. He’s been on this ride before, had caused horrible changes because he’d just wanted to save--

“I haven’t gotten to the even better news yet.”

Wally groans out loud. B, *not the time, man*.

“So far we can’t a reason behind the progression or which trap is going to set first.”

“You aren’t telling us something,” Bart guesses shrewdly, “this is even more cryptic than usual, B.” He notes a distinct *lack* of Red, Hood, and N in the picture.

“There’s a lot I’m not telling you,” the Bat comes back, “doing so would defeat the purpose of leaving the *bad* news out of this conversation.”

And because Barry was the OG Flash, was the one that initially agreed to be a part of the Justice League, he’s the one that squints at the Bat, looking past everything.

“You’ve figured out this isn’t just a time anomaly,” is Barry’s slow realization.

\*\*

\*\*

The Insidious Seven makes an entrance at the gala and gives the Triad enough time to grab Tim.

*Forty-Eight hours in the future*

Robin is irritable, twitchy riding down the elevator of Titan’s Tower. Being out of Gotham at a time like this is...*upsetting*. Even as much as a year ago, he would have balked at such an order, but in the time he has been wearing the mantle, the tunic, the *R*, he has come to understand the need for Father to have those he trusted take care of the parts not directly in front of him.

Thus, Robin is in Titan’s Tower.

Take into consideration the Justice League and Titans have been recruited to stand against the small army of gauntleted pseudo-metas while the Bats are running down the ones responsible for the creation and distribution of such weaponry, there are too few hands to deal with delicate things.

Well, *children*, that is. And for any of them to be called *delicate* is an offense to their very natures. Robin smiles grimly because they are already *Bats*.

He hadn’t expected Father to acquiesce to his demand to go to the Tower, question the children in person considering the amount of work still to do and how few the hands are, but with Drake backing him, with the very specific modifications to the gauntlets on the big screen behind them, the obvious *danger*, even in Titan’s Tower, Batman had simply agreed it was a sound idea. Putting the kids with the meta couple the League had agreed on could prove disastrous if Genesis came after them again. The side-talk between the new iteration of the dynamic duo is Father laying out all the intended steps in the pending plan, a substantial move giving Robin a jolt of realization(*this...he does this with Grayson and Drake and Todd*). Father pulling him aside with special instructions, giving him the details on the other side of the plan, trusting him to use the right judgement, to know when it’s time to *move*.

It is a step in bringing them closer together as partners, and Robin has already sworn to himself that he will not disappoint.

As he expects, as the elevator doors softly slide open, and the familiar scene in the Communal Floor is immediately assessed, the four children looking up at him with determined, fighting faces, prepared to step into battle--

(*With him*)

\-- and his smile is white in the light just before he strides off the elevator, expecting them to follow.

He jumps right into the next steps, “you will tell me all you know. Then, we shall make a plan.”

Karmen’s eyes dart away, narrow slightly. Leo twists his fingers, fails to notice he suddenly has cat ears peeping out through his hair. Charlie is biting down on his lip, eyes wet with whatever he’s holding in, and Caro–

Caro is glaring up at him with her little jaw *tight*.

Robin turns to give them his full attention, vaults himself up on the low bookshelf to sit cross-legged, and waits for the inevitable piece that’s been lying in wait right here all along.

\*\*

*Twenty-Four hours in the future*

He adjusts his tie while sitting down in front of his system. Eyes move down the silent hallway, but there’s nothing but calm and quiet.

*Necessary. This…is necessary.*

He flips record to *start*, looks up into that camera with game face on.

“By the time you see this, I’m already at the Science and Technology Gala. Terrible bad guys are probably going to be waiting on me, so hopefully you two aren’t pissed enough to skip out on the *come save me* part of the plan--”

He knows he’s going to have redemption in this one once they get how there is very, *very* little *time*.

Something like there being a moment where he gets ready for the Gala and Dick and Jason talk about how hot he looks in his suit - not in this bit, maybe after the smut at the perch? That would be awesome.

\*\*

*Twelve Hours into the future*

B’s face is utterly super serious and KF straightens automatically. He has an immediate feeling churning in the lower part of his stomach.

The Batman finally found something.

Which explains why Wally is at his back and Barry staring B down from behind the cowl of the Reverse Flash costume.

“I’ve run the algorithms,” B is saying with the usual amount of *gloom* and *doom* when it comes to time fuckery. “A residue of sorts has been left in the time stream, marking each event that’s been touched by the same technology.”

“And we’ve got to go back and set it right before the dominoes start to fall,” Barry starts slowly, fingers twitching against his sides. He’s been on this ride before, had caused horrible changes because he’d just wanted to save--

“There are things I still need to substantiate before I send you three through time.”

Wally completely *facepalms* and groans out loud.

\*\*

*Three hours into the future*

“I’m going to take a leap here,” B starts out slowly, staring down Tim’s very, *very* still figure, “and say you were eventually going to tell us about this.”

Around him, Dami, Alfred, O, Jason, Dick, Steph, and Cass are giving him the proverbial *stink-eye*.

His gloved hands tighten while he stares up into the still motion image on the screen of the big computer. If there was ever a time to facepalm, that moment would be now. “Do I need to mention this really isn’t your problem?”

# This Missing Scene Idea

To be re-worked

Fracture 30: The missing piece :D

While hanging on to Jay on the back of the Ducati, Dick listens to his low voice over comms.

\*\*

And here if you want you can have Jason and Dick crashing into the perch to keep Tim away from the Gala (B’s orders) and maybe have that ‘talk’ that Timmy was promising them. And at first it’s totally not going the way they want it to. Timmy not talking about his feelings but bringing up just how he thinks that Dick and Jason are messing with him and to cut it out please. Like he’s not going to spill the fact that Dick and Jason are together, and he knows that they love each other very very much so why are they pulling this shit?

Getting a reprieve is really a *thank fuck* when he comes up the stairs from the Perch’s hidden basement. He’s got less than twenty-four hours before B comes looking for him, and the delivery hits the harbor with a *whole* lot of surprise bad guys. Since the White Triad has location dampners, they have no idea where the shipment is coming from, only the log book for when it should arrive.

Since he feels like nothing less than *ass* about being helpless, all he can do is try to crack more info about the gauntlet–

–where he can finally get a *breath*.

Out of the suit with coffee already smelling up the Perch, he starts with results from the Titans and JL, everything they’ve connected with the data in the lab

“Don’t you fucking *get it?*”

Whatever smart ass comment he was formulating dies in his mouth because Jay comes at him with the Red Hood stalk, the rolls of his hips tight and dangerous.

(But the crazy thing about it? He doesn’t even *flinch* anymore, has to really *think* about the last time he *did*.)

But he apparently looks almost as confused as he *feels* because Dick is facepalming in the corner, and Jay’s sneer turns into something very close to *frustration*.

“Yer the goddamned *Detective*,” and it feels strangely like being stalked by a predator when Jason rounds the table and moves right into his personal space, coming close enough for Tim to press back against the counter by the coffee maker. “So, I’m gonna *guess* you need more evidence to put it *together*, right Timmy?”

He completely doesn’t make a noise when it’s a bare hand on his neck, warm and just the right kind of tight to move his jaw, tilt his face upward, and his heart picks up, skips a beat because those blue eyes flecked with green are looking right down at his *mouth*.

And not even *his* bullshit tech is strong enough to pass this off as anything *other* than Jason Todd coming on to him.

(*With his *boyfriend* moving slow and easy closer to the show, no less.*)

“Please tell me you didn’t get hit with stupid sex pollen on the way over here,” and he’s proud as *fuck* of himself for still being able to *brain right now*. “That would be a real downer, you know.”

Jay blinks, just a second, and drops his head a little for the laugh in his chest to filter out. When he looks at the trapped bird, the smirk is sharp and this side of *something else entirely*.

“Enough deflectin’. Like I don’t pay *attention*?” Jason leans in just a little, to lower his voice and talk closer to Tim’s mouth, “I know how you lookit Dickie. How you sometimes lookit *me* when y’ think I don’t *see*.”

*Oh. Oh fuck…*

“Jay, I–” and his brain locks up because did he mention *fuck? **(And maybe here Tim tries to apologize, tries to turn it into a ‘It’s just a stupid crush that keeps biting me from the past. I won’t let it affect the mission or your relationship, I would never want to get in between you like that. To which Jason replies, “Even if we want ya too?”)*

But it’s the slide of those eyes back to his mouth, of Jay’s tongue coming out to run over his lower lip, and the *picture* makes him, *Red Robin*, vigilante bad ass, *Titan*, go wide-eyed and breathless, caught up in the Red Hood’s grip.

“S’all right,” Jay soothes, moves past that *mouth* to talk against Timmy’s ear, keeping this between *them*. And he can feel Baby Bird swallow, can let his scratchy jaw move against the exposed throat (since he wanted his answer from the last time and gets a suppressed shudder in the literal palm of his hand.) “I shoulda put it all together before *now*, Baby Bird, but still, me and Dickie are *real* happy ta *know*. It ain’t just *us* what *wants*, you feel me?”

“I…” while Tim’s face is getting hot, his mouth working without anything coming out because *God, he was so ****close**** again, and he would just have to turn his head and they could be--* “I shouldn’t have. I’m *sorry*\--” and he tries to pull back a little, just to *think* about how he could fix this. How he could make it all right.

But that hand tightens, keeps his right where he is, and that bigger, bulkier body steps just closer, a knee between his, bracket him in, keeping him from *running*.

“Stop being stupid. Lemme lay it *out* fer ya nice and easy. All’s ya gotta do is tell me ‘*yes*, Jay, I wantcha,’ and me and Dick are gonna take ya ta *bed*.” And how *close *Jason’s mouth is to the bare skin of his *throat* is fucking *criminal*. “An’ we’re gonna make *sure* ya understand where we’re coming from.”

His breath leaves in a rush, his knees might just wobble a second because *how hadn’t he seen it?* The clues were all *there*, and he’d ignored it, been too afraid of everything. The pain it could be if he interpreted everything *wrong*.

(That little *tussle* in the Tower, the almost-there kiss, all of it meant he might *not* be riding the one-sided thing after all). (But knowing Tim, he might think of this as a one time thing, might need the boys to straighten that notion out fast)

But since those blue-violet eyes have gone wide and darkened with his own wants, dark enough to make a low growl start in Jay’s chest, the older vigilante knows *just the thing* to give him a little bit of a *push*.

So Jay does what he needs to what when some people need a little bit of *convincing*. “Here’s the best *clue* yer gonna get, since the picture ain’t there fer you, Timmy.”

(And dammit, now he can feel Jay smiling, and the hard outline of his chest and abdomen against Tim’s nerd shirt, and the terrifying thought, the realization *I’m not wearing anything armored,* so if he gets the *slightest* contact more, he’s going to get the fuck out of this or be horribly embarrassed for life--).

“Whenever I talk about cha *dirty*,” warm and breathy against his throat, “Dickie moans like a whore and comes at the sound of yer *name*.”

*Embarrassed for life it is*.

“Oh my *God*,” and his eyes shoot to the eldest vigilante that has unobtrusively managed to find a comfortable spot on his counter and is unabashedly holding Tim’s coffee cup to sip on, watching them with hooded eyes.

“Dick,” because his face is *on fire* and the unbearably *soft* touch under his ear is lips and *mouth* and it is *everything* in the deepest, darkest, most hidden parts of him, things he couldn’t help but *want* and had no other option than to *suppress* and move on. “This isn’t...this *isn’t*\--” *what it looks like*.

But it apparently *is* because the smile he gets back is just such a shade *darker* than the one he’s so used to seeing *directed at him*.

(That...that isn’t the *hey little brother* grin and his eyes blow wide at the sudden but inevitable *epiphany*.)

“I think there’s going to be a confession period later, *much later*, when we can all figure out when the feelings started to be there.” And Dick slides off the counter fluidly, wondering exactly what Jay *said* to make Tim’s face go *that red,* *that* *fast*, but he’s absolutely positive it was something relentlessly dirty and insinuating.

Well, he *hopes so* anyway. Knowing Jay and how right on he feels about this, the odds are 70/30.

And it’s something close to destiny how the opportunity *right here*, right *now* is one they will probably never have again, it’s a one-shot deal. But once the detective in Dick Grayson finally lets himself *see* it in the way those hands grip the counter, the flutter of eyes at the soft touch, the aborted movements to reach *out*, stopping himself from being able to *have*.

And everything Jason put together before they made the very conscious decision to come here and have a little *talk* (and it wasn’t meant to go this far, not with a very real case they’re right in the middle of) goes right out the window in the way Tim shudders and forces himself to draw *back*. It’s so obvious (*now*) how the prodigal son is so severely in *need*, how he’s kept himself away from everything for so long, he literally can’t *bend*. Dick can see it in the peripheral, all the moments of aborted moves, the way those eyes move away too fast so he won’t get *caught*, how he draws back automatically.

Timmy can’t, *won’t*, let himself be *had*.

So much that it affects him unconsciously at this point, and it’s a painful realization that Dick had just *passed it off* as stupid echoes of his own *wants*.

(“I’m telling ya right now, swear it on m’ second chance, Baby Bird *wants* us,” is Hood’s low, warm voice through the comm in his ear on the way over. “Can’t let himself believe, but he’s got it just as *bad*.”)

So. Time to test that theory, Jason.

“But I need something first,” the mug is out of his hand, Jay sliding back so Dick can take his place, to pin the flighty Red Robin against the counter and stare down at those *eyes*. “Tim, I need to *know* it’s not all me. I need to *know* it’s not just us, but it’s there for you, too.”

And with both hands on the counter, laying over Tim’s tight ones, unconsciously bracketing him in with both arms, Dick leans down a little, takes in the softly opened mouth, the rise and fall of chest against his.

“D-Dick, I--” but it’s soft and light, nothing to even *deter* him.

“Tell me *no*,” is breathed right against his *mouth* and the *noise* coming out of him is something he usually tries (and succeeds) to *hide*. “Tell me *no*, and I’ll st--”

But it’s a stupid thing how his body out-thinks his brain, how he turns just *enough*, rises up on his toes slightly, how the first touch against Dick’s mouth is like something electric shocking down his spine. It’s stupid how he realizes this might be his *only chance*. Even with the possibility this could drive them away, that he probably couldn’t be *little brother* ever again; it’s a moment when his half-functioning brain tells him it’s worth it to at least have this *once*.

The progression, the hands suddenly on him, the mouth opening his for deeper and *wet* and *more, God please more* is something he’s wanted, imagined, fantasised for a better part of his *life*. And they’ve come to the point where he can grip Dick’s hip without thinking, where the hard grip he’s got on a bicep is completely keeping Dick from stepping out of his grasp.

The rest of him is helpless, taking and moaning inside that *mouth*, settling back down on his feet when Dick steps closer into him, grips him to hold him *still*, and *take*.

And even though time seemed to be running out on them with the case, the kids, the baddies waiting to make the next move, on meta tech that could kill *thousands*, this moment is outside of it *all*.

When they draw back to breathe, Dick’s eyes are so dark, and he doesn’t even give Tim a *second* to pass this off or push him away (*no more pushing, Timmy, my heart can’t even *take it* anymore)*, to keep himself from what he *needs*, from what they all obviously, desperately *want*, Dick dives back in, takes his mouth even harder, trying to tell him in that motion alone how long he’s *waited* for this.

And Tim rides along with it, not fighting when hands move over him and under his thighs, lift him up with the same incredible strength that’s caught him over and over the last few months, in his early days, in the times the plan occasionally failed and someone was there to pull him out by his cape. The strength that caught him numerous times when he was *that *Robin, a kid that shoved himself into their world unwelcome. The strength that caught him from imminent death at the hand of Ra’s al Ghul when he was almost *nothing* to them.

(But he *is* something to them, isn’t he? Isn’t that what they’ve been trying to prove all this time?)

It’s an automatic reaction that his legs wrap around Dick’s hips, lock his ankles and hold on even if he doesn’t think the older vigilante would really drop him. It’s the most pliant he can really remember being, letting Dick hold him, take control of his mouth, turn him so they can have *more*.

He doesn’t even register the step back until Jason slides in behind him, his hips twitch when hands and calloused palms were working under his shirt, sliding up his sides--

His upper body jolts when fingers find sensitive skin around the bandages from shit like shrapnel and bullet holes, and he should feel the pain of his injuries first, should feel the usual *owfuck* he rides like a *pro*, but the bare palms and pads of fingers, the callouses scraping against his sensitive sides wins out in the sensation competition.

(And it’s a body accustomed to *pain*, but one that is pretty damn helpless against the opposite.)

The slow-burning arousal in his belly climbs higher at the penetration of Dick’s mouth and the movement of Jason’s hands over him. He can’t really *help* arching his back into those hands, opening up for everything they can give him.

When Dick finally pulls off, Jay’s smirk is something so devastatingly *hot* he should feel nothing less than *ashamed*.

“‘At’s right. I think yer finally gettin’ the *picture*, yeah Detective?”

With Dick starting to mouth behind his ear, work the sharp edge of teeth over his pounding jugular, Tim lets his head fall back to give open access. The move gives Jason the opportunity

“I could always,” he manages out, “use more *evidence*, Jay.”

It’s terribly cliche right before Jason Todd ducks his head down to give him something slow and *dirty*, teasing his mouth. Just the tip of his tongue over Tim’s bottom lip, nipping at the corner of his mouth.

“Mister Detective needs more *evidence*, Dickie,” is right against his mouth, Jay’s eyes focused in on him, and *fuck* his eyes. The same blue as the painting in the Manor, the same clarity, no green flecks in sight.

“Oh *God*,” he manages, staring up helplessly. Dick picks that moment to tighten down on his thighs and start moving his hips, grinding them together.

Jason’s grin gets wider, and he leans up, leans away, gripping Tim’s sides tighter, “How’s that fer yer evidence.” He chuckles and licks his way to get s’more of Timmy’s taste.

And there, right there, Tim can feel the hot press of Dick’s arousal against his. *As if Dick didn’t bother wearing a jock when he decided to come over.* Plus there’s physical hard proof firm in the small of his back and driving Tim crazy. To think he’s wanted , even if this is a fling, even if these two must have a head injury to even consider it is maddening...addicting. He can hear his heartbeat pound in his ears and fuck did that whine come from him?

“Looks like you’re stuck between two hard places, huh Timmy?” Dick coos darkly into Tim’s collarbone.

“Maybe,” And Tim tries to pull his brain cells together to slap a tiny smirk on his face, “But I’ve been in–*ah*–hard situations before.”

\*\*

“*Fuck,* this is gonna be *good*, Timmy,” Jason breathes against the back of his neck. “Waited long enough, too damn long, you *feel me?*

But his brain is too busy short-circuiting with Dick’s mouth moving down the side of his throat. He jolts in the cradle of their hands when teeth set on his jugular and *bite*.

His eyes roll back, nerve endings flaring to life when more hands work his shirt up, pass over his skin.

# Convo with Satire

**Hailey Mowen: **Okay I LOVE WHAT YOU PUT DOWN IN THE FRACTURE 30 DOC.

So many cool ideas for you to bounce with.

**Amanda Andrick: **XD XD XD

**Hailey Mowen: **Just wow babe

I can't wait to see how you pull it all together

**Amanda Andrick: **It's going to be killer

...

**Hailey Mowen: **I like the countdown idea very very much.

**Amanda Andrick: **:D

YAAASSSS

**Hailey Mowen: **Of the \_\_\_\_\_\_hours in the future.

**Amanda Andrick: **THANK-YOU BABE

\*phew\*

I love the damn time things >.<

It's really like the tying point I think. Everything has to do with the time fuckery

**Hailey Mowen: **You might want to clump similar snippets together? Like B dropping down that it's the triad in the first '3 hours in the future' part.

**Amanda Andrick: **I have to rewrite it to match up lol I started the main part of it out differently >.<

I'm kind of debating which one to go with because I like them both

**Hailey Mowen: **Or when B talks to wally and company, there you could bring up the diana and Clark motherhenning opportunity too?

**Amanda Andrick: **!!

!!!!!

!!!!!!

WHERE'S THE REST OF THE JLA FUCK GOT IT

**Hailey Mowen: **I don't think you have to get rid of either, just merge them together?

**Amanda Andrick: **Kk. That makes sense. I like Tim getting kind of defensive about it at first. Like, that just very like him.

Shit. Like, that is just his personality.

I'm damning myself by watching these stupid Marichat vid comics on Youtube

**Hailey Mowen: **Oh and in this I do think Jason and Dick making talking about getting proof in the shower might be a good idea. Maybe Jason saying Timmy owning up for a 'talk' and how far they want to go with this? How far they want to jump Timmy if they can see the 'green' light?

Jason's sliding hand on the open skin that Tim's suit shows was very sexy. Good job.

**Amanda Andrick: **XD I am so trying with this thing. I think now that I have other things off my plate, I need to just resist things like temptation until I have a bigger part of the main story done >.<

**Hailey Mowen: **And if the bats figured out about the Triad, what things did each of them agree to do to delegate the work from Tim? Also why does Tim still trap them in the Perch? Is it to keep them away from Ra's? Or just let Tim go to the gala that's obviously a trap? You could even have B say, "No, going to the Gala is a bad idea, we're not doing it." And Tim goes mentally, '...I'm doing it.'

**Amanda Andrick: **Weeeellllll

**Hailey Mowen: **But temptation is fun babe.

**Amanda Andrick: **Here kind of the progression:

**Hailey Mowen: **Okay, lay it on me.

**Amanda Andrick: **So yes, the Bats do find out about the White Triad. However, the bigger picture is why Tim traps Jay and Dick in the Perch later on after the smut. The bigger picture is the time-relationship element. They do figure out the gauntlet the TItans picked up, the one that Kon got trapped on himself? That one is being used to manipulate time (the speedsters), which is shipped by the Triad, and created elsewhere

Tim needs to find the 'elsewhere' and the Triad will try going for him again (figuring that part out too), so he needs to be at the Gala alone, playing bait

Just, being the bait takes him further than the Triad. It takes him straight to the LoA

And fucking Ra's

**Hailey Mowen: **Is Ra's still going to kidnap Tim? Plllllllease have him kidnap Tim please.

**Amanda Andrick: **You KNOW he def is

**Hailey Mowen: **So no one but Tim knows about he elsewhere?

**Amanda Andrick: **Ra's is the one that's trying to re-set the time line, and he wants the detective close

**Hailey Mowen: **And how did Tim know about the time-relationship thing about the gauntlet?

Like didn't B make a mention of it?

**Amanda Andrick: **Well, really it's a circle of supervillains maybe working in conjunction and Ra's is one point int he star.

**Hailey Mowen: **To the speedsters?

**Amanda Andrick: **Ah. So, the Tower is running analysis on the thing and the results have a gravitational effect. But, certain aspects of it can be modified to track other gauntlets okay

This is why they need the WE trackers Tim came up with :D

I'm sorry. PLOT. SO MUCH PLOT IN MY SKULL FOR THIS

LIKE ALL THESE ELEMENTS ARE GOING TO MEAN SOMETHING

**Hailey Mowen: **Which points to the triad? I think you might what to include a bit of a recap just to help readers (old and new) about these different parts.

At least point out the obvious points of this villain star and then maybe state that there's just one or two that B or Tim can't figure out.

**Amanda Andrick: **Well. The crates the Triad is delivering, the reason Tim came back to Gotham this time, will have the components to make the gauntlets :D and thus the Triad is supplying these things

And you are so right babe

You are SO right.

**Hailey Mowen: **Like they know that \_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_ are involved but there's at least one more in the wings that the bats have to drag into the light inorder to beat them up properly.

**Amanda Andrick: **I'm always afraid of hitting the line of giving everything away and then not giving enough >.< Keep me honest

**Hailey Mowen: **I think it's okay to be obvious at this point.

**Amanda Andrick: **LOL to beat them up properly is beautiful

**Hailey Mowen: **Like you've had 29 chapters of build up

It's okay to lay out some reveals now

**Amanda Andrick: **Okay. OKAY. You are absolutely correct

**Hailey Mowen: **Not all, but like unwrapping the first layer of this awesome present.

**Amanda Andrick: **So, most of the things I told you are happening in this chapter. I've got some rudimentary parts to it. Like everything is going to start happening after YES B drops it is the Triad and we found your damn crates

So fam feels first

**Hailey Mowen: **Plus I really think it could be fun that B knows that this gala is a trap for Tim, so he DELIBERATELY sends Dick and Jason over to keep Tim occupied. (Because...B figured out their attraction and gosh he didn't want to say anything....but...he does want all his boys happy dang it)

**Amanda Andrick: **Then these breakdowns. Results come in from the Tower at what the gauntlets can do. At the sensor's calibration to maybe track other gauntlets

**Hailey Mowen: **As a way to make sure Tim doesn't go to the gala while Bruce sets up things with the justice league to bash some heads.

But Tim is Tim.

And Tim manages to trap Dick and Jason in perch.

**Amanda Andrick: **Oh? It's all B's fault. Hm, that would def be a convo I could imagine. Tim manages to circumvent good intentions, but B technically got him laid first

**Hailey Mowen: **When B finds out it's bad. Maybe Jason gets a call through to him, all hissing about it while Dick is trying to break through some of the perch's 'accomodations'

But if B tries to hack Tim's com, Tim turns it off.

Because Tim is on a mission to unravel this unknown and he's going to get it.

That's 'his' part B.

**Amanda Andrick: **If B isn't in Gotham at the time, he'd be out of luck because Tim made sure everyone else is on something else, so he can go maskless while they're all occupied

**Hailey Mowen: **Maybe B tries to talk to Tim through the com first? But Tim says basically I am letting you help, but in the end this is my fault, and this is my part to fix it.

And then turns it off like a turd.

Or says to B that getting Dick and Jason to 'pin' him down in his perch was....

**Amanda Andrick: **He'd ditch it in a potted plant

**Hailey Mowen: **well Tim didn't expect that B would do that.

"Two birds with one stone, Tim."

**Amanda Andrick: **"You have...tendancies. We're all aware. Don't get upset if some of us have to plan for tem."

Them lol

**Hailey Mowen: **"Besides if you don't want to prove why we do have them, you turn around, wait for backup. Do not. go. in. alone."

OHHHHH

IDEA

**Amanda Andrick: **O.O

**Hailey Mowen: **Here Timmy maybe first makes a step in the 'back to the family' movement by saying something like, "It's okay B, if something happens..." And Tim has a flashback of the triads, takes a shaky breath because there is a part of him that IS a little scared and nervous. "...I know I can count on you to find me."

"I know I can count to you to come after me."

"I know my...dad...is going to come save me...this time."

"This time...you're here for me."

**Amanda Andrick: **Oh God. It's the 'I have faith' moment.

Hmmm

**Hailey Mowen: **And then he click the com off at B's strangled, "no."

each and every hideout to burn it to the ground.

He will find HIS SON.

**Amanda Andrick: **It's crazy how Tim is running out of time, making the situation more desperate to find out where the gauntlets came from. It can tie back to time again there

**Hailey Mowen: **(Heh. Determined to win the 'where's red robin?' game)

Why is Tim running out of time?

Is it the movement of the gauntlets?

Their production?

Is the shifts in reality due to the architect?

**Amanda Andrick: **That's kind of the theme I think. Like all these traps have been set in time by the architect and once they activate, it's going to change the timeline

Like hit the multiverses. Thus the speedsters

**Amanda Andrick: **Yes :D The architect will come in probably at the end.

Heh, there's kind of a reference to the new 52 world and the anamolies in time the Watch Tower has been tracking

So, there's probably seven main spots in time that have been boobytrapped for lack of a better word to go off. Once one event happens, it triggers another a few years or whatever later

**Hailey Mowen: **Gimme an example?

**Amanda Andrick: **For the architect, it's a world where Batman never lost his parents. Where Krypton never expoloded.

A literal 'no more bad days'

So....just kind of collapsing the multiverses to make one reality in her own image kind of thing

Which she is able to do with her natural power. The guantlets, produced by the guys that held the kids held her too, and thus some of the gauntlets can traverse time.

**Hailey Mowen: **So that's what the architect wants (but it would dissolve the justice league entirely)

**Amanda Andrick: **Yuuuuup

Bad guys are still bad guys. It gives them leeway to take power

What they don't understand is, she means to change it so they don't become bad guys either.

**Hailey Mowen: **But would the gauntlets be used? A guy uses it to go back into time and 'fix' or 'rework' the timeline?

So without the justice league in place the bad guys would have to opponents to stop them?

**Amanda Andrick: **Pretty much :D

Ah, like the one that got stuck on Kon, the gauntlets aren't perfect. It's DNA fuckery, so the malfunctions were really helpful in the Titans taking them down

Thus the damaged trackers and the Triad ready to deliver Tim on a silver platter

**Hailey Mowen: **And Ra's figures that wish of the Architect out? (Who's Caro right? But Caro can read and control minds? How does that relate to Time travel?)

**Amanda Andrick: **It's not actually Caro, but she's a child that was with them. They thought she was dead and thus Rob and the littles are going after her

He's going to lead them :D

**Hailey Mowen: **Wait explain the use of Tim's trackers again. Like it's to help the bad guys make sure the trackers get into the right year of the timeline maybe?

Ahhh so a fifth child.

And Rob figures that out. Maybe he goes back into researching the littles and finds out there's a fifth child since the gauntlets have the kid's abilities.

**Amanda Andrick: **Yes. That cut away scene is where he gets the deets by giving out the findings on the gauntlet

**Hailey Mowen: **(ALSO READ A CALL TO REMEMBER AND I'M FREAKING OUT. IS MY BABY TIM ALIVE? IS TIM NOW A MASS MURDER? WHAT THE FLIP?)

**Amanda Andrick: **You know, that trackers being altered for time is more interesting that being able to track one another in the same time

God, it really is a complicated plot isn't it?

**Hailey Mowen: **Yes babe. It really is. And that's not a bad thing. It's just something you need to lay out for the readers a bit more is all.

Because it's a fantastic thing really.

So many parts and things that will finally be connected together?

AWESOME

**Amanda Andrick: **I hope so >.<

I hope it turns out as epic as I imagine it in my head

**Hailey Mowen: **So trackers, they want to alter the trackers for time travel so the bad guys can place their guys in the timestream more accurately?

Is that why the trackers are wanted?

It will amanda. Already it's an epic thing and I know it won't disappoint.

I mean already the little snippets you had for me to read ARE DELICIOUS.

**Amanda Andrick: **\*dying all over the place\*

All over the place

**Hailey Mowen: **YOU CAN DO IT YOU GLORIOUS, GORGEOUS CREATURE.

**Amanda Andrick: **Thank youuuuuu omg I know it's so much, but I value everything you have to say >.< It's been so long for Fracture, but dammit I just want it so much to move

ah, move forward with it

**Hailey Mowen: **And I will support you in any way I can!

**Amanda Andrick: **Just by being you and reading things I shove in your face >.<

**Hailey Mowen: **WHICH I DO VERY VERY GLADLY.

**Amanda Andrick: **I had such a strange request for the old things I had on jotter pad and threw those in a doc too, but really it's just snippets of the old storyline

You DO put up with my ramblings quite brilliantly :D

**Hailey Mowen: **Okay so (suggestions to reveal things to the readers if you want) you could have B explain to Wally and KF that the 'bad' or 'good' news is that messing with the timeline like this could make the 'bad' things in their lives disappear but then they the justice league would disappear. And have Tim mentally push to go to the Gala because he knows and tells how important his trackers are for the timeline scheme and therefore the 'unknown' producer needs him.

**Amanda Andrick: **Yes, yes, I like all of this

**Hailey Mowen: **Plus Damian explaining the to little that the gauntlets have their powers, but one power that they can't figure out the origin of would have to belong to one of them? And then caro and the crew talk about the fifth child and its freaking GO TIME FOR ROBIN.

**Amanda Andrick: **IT IS. HE'S GOING TO HAVE THE BALLS TO ACTUALLY WEAR ONE TO FIND THE ARCHITECT

**Hailey Mowen: **And connect the gauntlets and trackers and timeline together AND WHY BABE? IS THE ARCHITECT HIDDEN IN TIME?

AND CARO COULD HELP FIND THEM

WITH HER AWESOME MINDPOWERS

**Amanda Andrick: **She def is. She's waiting to trigger everything :D

**Hailey Mowen: **AND THE LITTLES HELP TOO.

**Amanda Andrick: **And yes, Caro does help find her! Charlie helps because the tech is his thing.

**Hailey Mowen: **And Ra's needs the last codes from Tim (as well as just breaking down Tim for his own use)

**Amanda Andrick: **Leo and Caro are the team leaders at this point, of course they're going to go. They have a plan

**Hailey Mowen: **for the trackers I mean.

**Amanda Andrick: **Yup.

That's it. He needs the Detective able to use his hands

At some point

**Hailey Mowen: **Karmen gets them passed the bad guys unnoticed so they can get straight to the architect.

Maybe Leo was closest to the architect and can help talk them down?

**Amanda Andrick: **That is fucking good. Leo didn't used to be the oldest. She was.

**Hailey Mowen: **Can the architect start this whole thing without Tim's trackers?

**Amanda Andrick: **Yes. The power is hers naturally

The trackers are only needed with the gauntlets

**Hailey Mowen: **And one more time the trackers help the gauntlets do\_\_\_\_\_\_?

So she starts it and the bad guy minions help in certain places of the timeline by being in the right places using the gauntlets?

**Amanda Andrick: **Track one another. So if Gauntlet B is active, gauntlet A can lock on to it

**Hailey Mowen: **And gauntlets can meet up?

In different times? Or in different places of the same time?

**Amanda Andrick: **Yeah. Can also be found if the wearer goes rogue

**Hailey Mowen: **In different times? Or in different places of the same time? So that the wearer sticks with the plan and does their role and nothing else?

**Amanda Andrick: **I think it would be interesting if Tim could further modify it so they could track one another in time. Manages to get the code to B before Ra's hauls him off to parts unknown

I think for the baddies that make it, it's a way to control the wearer. There are others with other powers

Like, they'll never get away

I

**Hailey Mowen: **Tim might be able to modify it so they (Damian) can track another gauntlet in time where the Architect could be hiding. But the baddies can only track each other in a specific time to control and make sure the wearer is doing what they're supposed to...so the gauntlet will kill them?

**Amanda Andrick: **I'm sorry babe, I gotta die

**Hailey Mowen: **Go die, sorry about this tracker thing being so confusing for me.

I just want to make sense of it for me, since it's such an interesting and important point.

(The whole reason why Tim was captured in the first place)

**Amanda Andrick: **Lol, it's fine. They're things Tim made the first time the Triad snatched him. It's for that system

Indeed :D

# More Notes for 30

In the Cave scene:

\*Jay has scanned the incoming ships (in 29), he’s got the code. The same one they got from the ghost drive, bringing it up on the screen of the Batcomputer

\*Dami bringing the system--the trackers were never recovered, that’s what he found out in WE’s system.

\*Dick: (what did he get from his little span of “captivity”)

All of it bringing the case together, it’s the White Triad. But even *more*, it’s finding out the group had expanded, was feeding, making everything possible.

\*\*

B hits up the Watchtower:

“Genetic markers?” J’onn questions lightly. Supers and WW exchange a glance and turn back to the comm line.

“Yes,” B replies from the Batmobile, Robin riding alongside. “The Titans fought a new supervillain group with some impressive meta tech. Not something we have capabilities for now.”

“You think it’s alien?” Is Supes, stepping closer.

“I’d say more advanced Earth tech,” B replies dryly, “I need to verify with the markers.”

“Batman,” and that’s Diana crossing her arms over her chest, warning in her tone.

“It might be associated with the Flash’s *project*.” He deadpans back.

The three heroes turn to one another in a singular move: *future technology.* Another baddie with powers over time and space causing the disturbances Barry and Wally have been investigating. *Wonderful*.

And here is where B is completely *aware* of why he’s the strategist of this bunch, “we can assume the tech doesn’t cause permanent damage. Well, that we know of *so far*. Superboy seems to have recovered.”

Superman’s spin snaps up, arms falling to his sides, “what’s that!?”

“And,” B continues, “Wonder Girl is to be commended de-arming it after the hard fight with Bloody Mary.”

Diana’s eyes widen, “has she been harmed?”

“The usual from what I could see,” B replies honestly. “I haven’t watched the feed, but I’m sure it was brutal enough to earn the contusions.”

“And Kon?” Clark demands, leaning down over the comm.

“...scans look good. Him? Not so much.”

J’onn shakes his head at Batman’s antics, and waves the two mentors away. “Go. Check on them and assure yourselves of their well-being. I will begin fulfilling Batman’s request.”

“Thanks!” Is Clark before he’s *gone*.

“Call us if you need more hands,” Diana is next, floating a second to wave before she takes off.

Alone with the driving vigilante, J’onn smirks from the control room, “devious of you, Bruce.”

“Just reporting in.”

“Mmhm. I suppose you will tell me next you were not aware the genetic markers belong to our most junior members.”

“The gauntlet used those markers, J’onn. That’s what they *did*, why they kept them alive.”

“...I know, Bruce. We will find them, and we will stop them.”

“Not if I get there first.”

The Martian laughs, “I suppose a compromise is in order. Allow me to send some of our people to the labs still functioning. Perhaps we can begin shutting them down before *more* weaponry is made.”

“That sounds like a perfect place to start. I’m going to approach from...another angle. Comm me with updates.”

The line cuts abruptly, leaving J’onn to chuff at the control board before shaking his head (and sometimes he wonders what they would do without him--honestly, *Earthlings*) in half-frustration, half-amusement. He takes up his seat again, screens coming online.

(Then MENTOR LOVE: while Tim is in the Cave and Clark is sitting beside Kon in the Tower all worried and attentive--he and Di totally bring food for the kids, just pizza everywhere. But Tim’s disembodied voice observes, “some exposure to the sun couldn’t hurt if you’re still feeling the drain.” “Magic always does it to me,” Clark confides with a shrug. “No one is 100% invulnerable anyway.” and those two just take off the sun for a hot minute, lol)

\*Leosworld making references to Tim running:

(B diverts him from going to the Perch immediately after saving Dick, Tim has a flashback thought of how the bomb went off and what deets he might have gotten from the van) So he IS in the Cave, and then there’s the thing from the Ch29 notes about the Bats finding out it IS the Triad he’s after. They give all the proof from above. And Tim just gets all tight and unstable, his voice wobbly while he finally adds:

“Th-there’s also a code. The code is…” (Get this from ch27 or 28, the one before Pain), so he’s throwing down all his own evidence.

GIve the Bats a moment with him so he can realize it’s not just on his plate now, it’s on THEIR plate. They’ve been running alongside him the whole time without him even noticing. And he might blink rapidly, he might try to step away from it, be angry because *it’s his fuck-up*, and the Bats getting pissed right back because they’re all in the vigilante game together and DAMMIT, they’re going to help him.

\*Once it’s established Tim is going to let them help (and maybe B is going to volunteer to check the crates, and maybe discussion of how he needs a little time off to attend the mentioned gala (where he knows more than he’s saying)\*

\*But once B and Dami and Alfred are running upstairs, Dick and Jason have their own moments to bracket him in:

He watches B and Dami disappear up the stairs for bedtime and sits back down at his workbench with the undersuit halfway down his body, elbows on the top to hold his face in his hands and just *breathe* a moment.

He doesn’t realize how long he’s been sitting there until it’s Dick’s hand on his shoulder and “--mmy?”

Dick and Jason have finished their post-mission clean-up, showered and smelling like *awesome*, enough that Tim’s tongue gets tied because he *really* didn’t mean to be down here long enough to be left alone with both of them. He even gets quickly to his feet, any excuse to move *away*, something about needing a shower himself because God he can’t even *look* at either of them (biology and adrenaline: those are the reasons they got so close, that he could have thought maybe--)

But Dick has him by both biceps, stopping the whole *run* mentality. His eyes are clear like glass, and maybe Tim just *imagined* the heat and darkness in them--

“Hey,” and it’s soothing, easy, “you’re okay. I know this has to be messing with you, but we’ve got your back, Timmy. You aren’t going after them alone this time, okay?”

He just blinks because *that* wasn’t what he expected. Maybe ‘stay the hell away from my boyfriend Tim’ or a gentle reminder that he and Jason are an item and anything that happened before was misconstrued.

Nothing like that happens, nothing like that happens *at all*.

“It’s fine,” he starts hesitantly, pulling back just slightly, eyes darting away, “I mean, we’re Bats, we’ve got this, and--and I really should get back to the Perch so I can get the deets B needs. I mean, I’m on my way out of here--” he makes another small step back, looking over Dick’s shoulder--

And bumps into Jason’s chest because the guy is just pulling out all his Bat-knowhow (and it’s telling how distracted he is by Dick’s aura and touch that he hadn’t noticed Hood sneaking up behind him). He completely doesn’t fold when Jason just steps in, pushing him between them, trapping him right where he shouldn’t *be*.

His eyes go wide when Jay slides a hand around the bare skin above where his the undersuit clings to his hips (because Alfred had shoved the suit down to check his bandages earlier and Tim just didn’t pull it up).

“Yeah,” Jay is leaning down, his nose just barely against the knob of bone at the base of Tim’s neck, making those eyes get *huge*. “Gotta start digging inta yer own search, right Timmy?”

“Yup,” he tries, but *fuck*, he really can’t breathe.

Jay hums against the back of his neck and Tim shudders all the way down, his eyes falling half-mast, giving Dick the proof he also *needs* (and maybe that mention while the two former Robins are showering? That they need one more bit of proof?)

Tim just sucks in a breath, his brain coming back on line because *you asshole, they think you’re freaked the ****fuck**** out by the Triad* and of-fucking-course they would think so.

So they’re being *nice* like they have been for months.
