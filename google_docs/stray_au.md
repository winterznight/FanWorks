The city is deceptively quiet.

The citizens of Gotham know the real sludge under the gothic architecture, the big bads always waiting behind bars and glass walls, planning and plotting with insanity as their only true company.

Stray is a tried and true Gothamite. He’s been through the best and the worst the city has ever seen, has ridden out the aftermath of destruction from the Quake, from Blackgate escapees, from the fall of Arkham, the plague that killed thousands.

And like so many, he’s still here, perched at the top of the Wallstone, getting ready to throw a line and jump into the night.

He’s perched perfectly on top of a certain camera, staying out of the city’s eyes and ears, wanting to keep himself on the downlow. The last thing he needed was to attract attention from the city’s protectors or their Oracle.

The suit is skin tight leather, a noticeable lack of outer armor to keep the design sleek and allow him extra flexibility. He decided to keep the scheme black with few silver accents other than the red-lensed goggles, ears, and a few places on his belt. The idea is stealth since he’s not trying to catch anyone’s attention. The small, powerful computer on his forearm is already synced up to networks under assumed IPs from a nursing home, a middle school, and a vegan restaurant. The grapple gun is a different design than he’s accustomed to and the gloves are thinner, but he’s got a few surprises in his belt for anyone that can’t play nice with this kitty. The thin throwing blades are shaped like claws in a sweet belt going across his chest, criss-crossing with the other belt full of knock-out paws. The toe beans were really a stroke of genius.

The ears rising up from messy dark hair swivel without even a hint of an electronic whirl, gathering sounds from the city, processing through the computer on his forearm.

He catches the ping from the Bat tech he’s literally crouching on, smiles a little when the other signals are further away from his current perch.

Since the Bats are off doing good, he has the chance to prowl around the bad part of town. After all, while the Red Hood is away, the cat can play.

\*\*

Things down in the Narrows is all kind of *business as usual*.

The Red Hood, the Bat what makes life a lil more difficult, has been strangely absent the last few nights while the other do-gooders are busy with parts of the city most people can walk through without a gun or a knife for personal protection.

(*What the hell is he thinkin’? It’s Gotham ain’t it?*)

Martin O’Malley grew up in the Narrows, cut his teeth on pickpocketing, learned to run from the 5-0 before he really learned to walk.

He’s one of the few natives that lived long enough to retire from the life. Don’t mean he stopped keeping his ear to the ground, or that the up-n-coming thugs tend to run their mouths at his bar where they don’t think cameras are recording.

It also means, he’s down with the Red Hood, had figured out a long time ago that Hood? He’s a native son of the neighborhood.

It’s the only reason he squeals (that and at his age, what’s he got to lose?) when that particular bad motherfucker comes walking into the bar after close, helps clean-up a little, don’t mind mopping the floors.

Tonight though.

It’s a kid in a fucking cat costume.

The goggles are red and the ears are the last straw.

“The fuck you supposed ta be, eh? Missed the memo? We got *bats*, not *cats*.”

“Cute,” the kid purrs out, squatting down on his nice, clean bar with dirty goddamn boots. The ears on his head actually swivel like they’re gathering sound.

“Take a look around, asshole. Ain’t nothing ta steal here,” Martin give one old hand a trembly sweep of the place in case the kid didn’t see the chewed up chairs, scarred tables, few pictures and knick knacks from old Gotham before the Quake lining the painted cement bricks. “Go back ta ya lady cat and tell ‘er there ain’t enough in the safe ta buy the guy Nip.”

“Not associated with that cat,” the kid smirks, knees all kinds of angles that make Martin’s own knees ache with sympathy. Too much a that and the kid won’t be walking for fuck when he’s sixty. “I’m here to find some scratchy toys for the Hood while he’s on a mission.”

And well, that?

Might make this whole encounter a little different than Martin first assumed.

“Fillin’ in for the Bat? What makes ya think I’d help out some do-gooder capes?” Martin rubs the bar down again, pointedly running the cloth right into those boots with a scowl.

The kid laughs a little and hops off, the belt around his waist jingle-jangle with all the pouches and shit.

“Because he tells me the best IPA in Gotham is the Joker’s Wild. Only one place in the city carries it.”

Martin takes a pause. Like he said, he grew up here, dealt a lot of pain in his younger years, enough to know he’s probably gonna come out the short end of the stick if the kids decides to be a little rough to get some answers.

“I do my homework,” the kid fills in, putting a hand to the back of one of his ratty chairs, claws on the ends of his fingers clicking along.

Before Martin’s eyes, the kid hefts the chair up, turns it upside down to put the seat on the table top. Moves around the rest of the chairs at the table.

“That don’t mean ya gotta A plus, smart ass,” his eyes go to the .38 Special under the bar beside the aluminum ball bat.

“I was awful in school, but Hood filled me in on some of the things going down. He’s not the kind to leave people hanging.”

That head swivels around, the red lenses of the goggles don’t give him shit for eye color. “But I think you already know that, Mr. O’Malley.”

A long sigh comes out and the guy finally looks away from the .38 and the ball bat.

“Fuck. Well, fine. Whadda ya know already?”

He keeps on scrubbing the bar while the kid keeps moving chairs, getting the floor ready for mopping. Kid gives the rundown on some juicy tidbits going on the next two weeks. A’course Martin hums and haws, restocking the beer cooler, nudging aside those Joker’s Wild the kid was yammering on about, stands back when the wide smile is followed by a keg getting set-up where it’s needed.

Kid sweeps and he mops up while the little asshole sits on the bar and listens to him talk up the chit chat he heard tonight slinging brews.

(Least he ain’t got feet on the bar this time.)

When he flips off the lights and dawn hasn’t quite yet hit the sky, the cat kid just crouches in a window and waves.

“Thanks again. I’ll check out what’s going down. Leave a saucer of milk in this window if you need me. Just tell them...you’ve picked up a Stray.”

A shit-eatin’ grin and the kid is gone for the night, leaving Martin to wonder if he needs to pick up Kibbles N’ Bits or another box of .38 shells.

\*\*

The furniture in the penthouse has been covered for months.

After a check to make sure the cameras are re-routed so no one knows someone is stopping in for a visit, Stray pulls the goggles up on his forehead and heads to the back rooms to grab some things he’s going to need in an out-of-the-way safehouse he keeps in Gotham.

His mini-computer pings when the red dots start congregating back to the outskirts of Gotham where Wayne Manor waits.

Even if the camera or motion sensors kick on around his hack, he’s got time to get gone before any Bats can show up.

(*Not that he would mind the reunion. It’s just...easier if they think he’s staying on campus and away from the potential dirty dealings in the city. After the last time he tried on Red Robin’s skin again, he got benched by his loving, asshole family. Retirement doesn’t suit him as well as he thought it would. B and N probably wouldn’t fight him if he wanted to come back, but he’s not willing to take the chance they might.*

“*But Timmy, you did such good things as Robin. And we’re so proud of you, aren’t we, Bruce?”**“So proud,” as B idly keeps typing at the big computer.*

“*But it’s time to hang it up and get your degree. If you want to come back after your Masters’… then, we’ll talk, okay? We’ll have a talk, just the three of us, right Bruce?”*

*“Of course, Dick. Whatever you want to talk about.”*

“*And maybe you can run comms for us during Summer break? That would be nice, right? Just like old times!”*

*“Mmhm. Old times, chum.”*

*“See? Now you keep your GPA up and call at least once a month so we won’t worry.”**“Don’t want Alfred to worry.”**“That’s right, Timmy. Don’t forget about us.”*)

The hallway feels longer somehow, his eyes flickering to catch the shadowy pictures on the walls, looking away before he starts getting more up in his head about it all.

He grabs the few things he needs in his old room, opening the hidden niches to get tool sets, clothes, older tech he plans to repurpose.

The computer on his arm vibrates softly, movement on The Whisper Gang. Cams also caught images of Jimmy Saviano leaving The Canary, one of the few bars along Finger River. He’s still running traces on a few other savory characters while taking on the usual night shift for a place like The Narrows.

It’s only been a few days, but he already knows he needs to get the last piece of his temporary fursona done to keep suspicion down just in case his luck fails and O gets an eye-full of the new mask in town.

(*It’s only until Jason gets back, he’d reasoned with himself leaving Ivy with way too much elation. It can be a good reason to switch to online classes. It can be getting his hands buried back in the Mission while still chipping away at a pointless piece of paper the Board of Directors pushed on him. It’s a way to work himself back in the life he’s missed more than he realistically thought he *would*.*)

The first night out in over a year was like taking a fucking *breath*. It’s crazy how Red Robin still slid over his shoulders and across his chest, how the utility belt hadn’t been nearly as heavy as he remembered, and the bandolier over his chest didn’t feel like a stone around his neck instead.

It was like when he used to –

(*be that kind of Robin*)

Stray pauses with a motherboard in hand, closes his eyes behind the goggles, sighs through his nose, nice and slow.

14 more minutes of loops before someone might notice. Doubtful but maybe considering the effort they’re still making when it comes to pull him back when he starts going too long without communication.

That whole year he spent looking for Bruce had an impact on the whole family; even worse, his refusal to come back when he sent the OG Batman back to Gotham was some kind of trigger he didn’t anticipate.

He’d fucked up by telling Bruce he didn’t have a place in the Manor anymore, had moved his things out without anyone even noticing, that it was all *fine*, okay? Dick made choices, and well, Tim was only the temp-Robin, right?

Less than 48 hours after Bruce landed back in Gotham, and Dick Grayson is pretty much knocking down the door to his safehouse in Keystone City, angry face right the fuck on. After a little more than a year since his cape was pulled out from under him, the urge to slam the door was more for self-preservation than anything else.

And it took...*time*.

Time he spent getting back in with the Titans for a while, time he spent getting stupid memes and short videos from Dick. Time he spent being CEO of Wayne Enterprises while Bruce got caught up on everything. Time he spent going to animal rescues with Damian. Time he spent working with the Red Hood on cases. Time he spent with Alfred playing chess.

All of it brought him to a good enough place to finally give in when the Board started pushing back about his lack of educational achievement.

(*“I want to try it,” he’d said to Bruce, Dick, Dami, and Alfred down in the Cave, still in Red Robin with the whiteouts down so he didn’t have to look anyone in the eye. “With enough capes in Gotham, I’m kind of redundant. It might be nice to try college.”*)

He hadn’t banked on being so far ahead of the game in Business and Finance that he’d be literally bored out of his skull.

Or that in less than a year living on campus being a *normal teenage kid*, he’d be dying to throw on a mask and beat the shit out of some bad guys *just* to have something interesting to do.

He also hadn’t banked on the whole family trying to be *nice* about keeping him out of the cape and out of the city, actually *respectin*g his decision.

But welp, here they are.

Sneaking around Gotham, taking an out-of-the-way safe house, pretty much stealing Hood’s territory hadn’t been on the docket. Once it was all capes on deck sometime after Bruce had taken the cowl back from Dick and those loveable assholes had lassoed him into coming into Gotham more than living in San Fran, his route among the rest of the Bats had narrowed to the lower part of Old Gotham, from the Upper West Side down to Tricorner Yards.

Once he went off to Ivy, his territory split between Signal and Batgirl, was the death throes of his vigilante career.

Which is why he doesn’t feel any kind of bad taking over The Bowery to the Narrows until Hood gets back from his little space trip with his team.

Moving in Gotham is like *breathing* again and fuck does it feel good to be back.

\*\*

Staying out of the Bat’s purview is the reason for the change in pseud. He needed something outside the realm of the Bats and Birds, tossing out throw-away personas while getting the safe house close to Arkham ready for a few weeks’ habitation.

(*He’d only left rudimentary things in his dorm at Ivy, nothing to trace him back. The shit laptop there is a crap Lenovo and if anyone wanted that piece of crap, it was expendable.)*

He needed stealth more than visibility.

Stray came out of old case files, mentions of the best cat burglar the city had ever seen. He hadn’t taken something like Cat Lad, wanting to keep away from Selina’s M.O. just in case he did get tagged on camera, didn’t want to give the Bats reason to believe a new master thief was in their city.

(*And no, he’s not going to admit to himself he feels like a Stray in his own town. He’s not going to go there, not when Dick calls him once a week to catch up and Alfred sends care packages to his dorm, when Dami emails him stupid animal gifs and O reminds him hacking the database to change his grades is really a piece of cake*.)

The image is complete with the half-cowl complete with cat ears and goggles. The infra-red lenses are just as good as the whiteouts on their dominoes, but the cowl itself is really a piece of technological genius. Based on Red Hood’s helmet design, he took it a few steps further, combining Bat tech with a little something different.

Stuffing things he needs in the bag he carries, he moves through the penthouse like a ghost, the belt tail flapping against the back of his ankles.

Once he’s out the window, his cowl will stop disrupting the Bat tech in the penthouse and cameras will start recording again.

Up on the next roof, hiding in the available shadows, red tint to the cityscape. He ducks around a patrolling Robin, holds his breath when the vigilante swings past his hiding spot.

A cleverly hidden safe house he’d set up during the year Bruce had been lost in time made sure it stayed off the Bat radar.
