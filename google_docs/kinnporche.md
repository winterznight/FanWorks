KinnPorche
Shameless KinnPorsche idea

In which, I cannot get this idea out so here we go.

This might be something like Porsche backs off after the Tawan sitch, just a bodyguard here, nothing else. And Kinn? He’s not someone to be denied, not when Porsche came *back* after he set the former bartender free. I own nothing.

“*Lock him up.*”

Takes the heart right out of him.

Because of course:

“*I trust no one*.”

Porsche grew up young, a street kid trying to keep his home from the hands of loan sharks and his little brother safe, fed, and happy. Things used to be easy when he was just *surviving*. Taking on a position with Thailand’s top family is where he really fucked up - even if he suspects Kinn engineered it that way from the beginning.

Ken and Big don’t say anything (for which he is absurdly grateful) or prod him in the back with their gun barrels on the way down to the holding cell Tawan was in just days before. He thinks they might feel bad for him because no one, *no one*, could mistake what was going on between him and Kinn--

(Well, except Pete, but Porsche just passes that off as Pete needing some “real world experience” and not just the kind with a gun.)

\-- and after everything they’ve been through, all the crazy attempts against them both, making it through a literal forest, to be told again *“I don’t trust you*,” is like another kind of bullet to the soft, fleshy insides.

It’s a different kind of bleeding out. For once, he’d prefer a real physical wound than the utter *agony* spilling out of his chest, his gut, leaving pieces of his heart scattered over the compound.

(And still, *still*, with the damnation ringing in his ears, he wants to have some modicum of faith, some small belief that Kinn wouldn’t believe the evidence, not from Tawan that’s already betrayed him. That Kinn would know him well enough, would actually fucking trust *in* Porsche after months doing this back-and-forth, will-we-or-won’t-we dance.

But he knows if he holds on to it too tight, the flare of hope that this is all Kinn’s elaborate plan, he’s only fooling himself. Stupid, gullible Porsche, falling for the promises, believing in the *best* of people--)

He clenches his jaw on the way down, his vision hazy, eyes burning with the effort to keep it all *in*. Ken’s a dick as usual, making half-assed comments about *big boss behind bars, who’s in charge of who now?* while Big silently locks him in and stares him down before Porsche turns his back on whatever Big might be trying to say with *that* expression.

They leave him in the sub-basement room, unarmed and alone with cameras hovering in the corners. He fights against himself, hands gripping each other to keep from shaking.

Vegas offers him a way out, a way to clear his name.

Porsche turns him down *flat*.

“You think it’s not going to make me look *guilty* if I break out?” Because *really*, how stupid does Vegas think he is? If he goes missing, the first place Korn is going to look is his parent’s house with innocent Chay just another weakness they can use against him. And he? Is not going to give the Theerapanyakun clan any reason to go after Chay.

Honestly, of the two of them, Vegas should know Kinn better than this, should *know* how it would look to Kinn if Porsche just disappears without--

Some things come together after Vegas takes off, pissed Porsche won’t leave the cell, and now there’s a pretty clear picture of who could be working with the insider. Who has the resources to set up the attempts on Kinn’s life. Who has the most to gain from Kinn’s death. Who has a very obvious *grudge*.

*“He always wants what’s mine*.”

It’s stupid how Porsche wants those words to mean *more*.

Three days in the cell.

Three days of keeping his back to the room, of wondering if he made the right call to turn Vegas down. Three days of Ken and Big bringing him food, water, of Ken shaking his head in mirth at the role reversal while Big just looks on with something else brewing under the exterior Porsche can’t translate. One day with Tawan flaunting victory in his face.

Three days of wondering if Yok was wrong all along and he *should* have tried talking to someone else to make Kinn jealous.

*Damn. *What a missed opportunity.

On day three, it’s Pete out of breath and flustered, apologetic.

“Tawan is gone…” he gasps a breath and pauses, winces back even while the keys dangle from one hand. “He. His evidence was fake. It took Arm some time to figure it out.”

“What else?” Porsche asks dully, expressionless. He doesn’t --*can’t*\-- think about Tawan leaving Kinn dead in his silk sheets, refuses to let the thought even form (*blood and wide-open eyes, unblinking with a film over them like Mes, Mes that Porsche killed to save Kinn’s life, their lives*). He takes a breath against the lump in his throat, against the racing of his heart.

“Y-Your brother is also missing. Khun Kim reported it an hour ago--”

Before he realizes he’s moved, his hands are wrapped around the bars.

“Let me out, Pete. *Now*.” And not Chay, not his precious Chay. Not after everything he’s done in the attempt to protect *Chay* from all of this.

Pete fumbles at the darkness in his tone, but finally gets the door open, the old hinges ringing out in the basement when Porsche slams it open.

He’s moving past Pete without actively thinking about it, not hearing whatever Pete might be saying.

No, no. He needs guns. He needs guns and his bike. Everything else can just fucking *wait*.

His focus is narrowed, long leaps up the stairs of the sub-basement with Pete hot on his heels.

His whole body is *tight* with the last threads of control before he goes off, and the fight is *on*. Something on his face might be why no one bothers to speak to him, to stop him while he’s striding through the opulent rooms on the first floor, fists clenched so tightly by his side until his fingers are numb.

He knows Pete’s jogging beside him, waving his special phone in his peripheral (probably because Kinn, *Kinn*, gave it to him to give to Porsche and he can’t even think about that right now, can’t think of what that *means*), but Porsche can’t *stop*, he can’t. If he stops, he’s going to start swinging, he’s going to get loud and violent. He’s going to start with kick jumps, and knees to the face. He’s going to snarl and smirk and go out for *blood*.

He’s wound too tight, ready to *snap*.

Big, well *Chan*, apparently thought about this because Big is standing outside the double doors, arms crossed that same expression on his face. He’s right next to Porsche’s bike, keys in hand, holster and a .45 with him.

(*And if Porsche had taken a moment, just a moment to really look, he’d recognize that silver .45 with the custom made stock and special order silencer that had already been in his holster once, back when Kinn trusted him with it.*

“Come back to me.”<br>

*Fuck. He cannot think about this now. Kidnapped little brothers first.*)

The fog covering his vision only slightly lifts when Big holds a palm out and comes in contact with the center of his chest.

“Take the phone,” Big orders. “We’re not going to try and stop you, but at least *take the phone*, Porsche.”

Pete answers that question by sliding it in his back pocket.

Three days of stink and stress and pent-up energy fades slightly while Big stares him down. It takes a moment for Porsche to close his eyes briefly and inhale the first real breath he’s taken in days.

Big hands him the holster, watches as he puts it on. Pete digs in a backpack he’s apparently been carrying while running after Porsche, pulls out an overshirt and shoves the backpack at him when he’s somewhat concealed.

He doesn’t say anything else to them. Doesn’t demand where Kinn is (*because the answer is obviously *not here) or if they’ve found anything, how they *knew* Chay was missing. He doesn’t demand footage or other bodyguards to help. He doesn’t rant about Korn’s promise his remaining family would be *safe* from all this.

He throws a leg over his bike and revs up instead, already planning out his next three moves before he even shifts into gear.

\*\*

The house is a mess. No one bothered to clean-up where the obvious kidnapping took place. The chloroform soaked rag still on the ground proves it.

A ball of pent-up energy and aggression, Porsche stalks around the first floor looking at every detail, his mind’s eye conjuring what Chay must have been doing before they came for him.

On his own, he doesn’t have any way to get trace evidence, fingerprints or cell phone records, not without calling Arm or Kinn back at the compound, and he doesn’t think he could even look Kinn in the face after sitting in the holding cell for three fucking days just for his *accuser* to get away without a hitch.

(*Tawan is Kinn’s mess to deal with, and Porsche is sure that’s probably what he’s doing. Protecting the family by dealing with the fallout. And why. Why is he even bothering with that moron right now anyway?*)

When his search of the house, of Chay’s room, of the backyard, all of it gives him nothing to go on except the rag, a new guitar in Chay’s room, and some tire marks. He yells out loud in pure frustration, fists clenched by his sides.

The vibrating phone in his back pocket adds another layer, and he jerks it out, arm back to throw the damn thing against the wall as hard as he can when the overload of helplessness reaches impossible levels.

Only Vegas’ name saves the phone from being pieces on the floor.

“*How* did you even get this number?”

“I can get a lot of things. Just have to ask the right questions.”

Because Vegas is an absolute jackass.

“As much as I wish I had time to deal with you, Vegas –”

“Your brother is missing, right?”

Something in his chest goes inexplicably cold.

If Vegas knows, he’s involved. At the very least, if Vegas knows, Kinn has to know as well, and let him leave without anything other than his lucky gun…

“I can help you,” is how Vegas draws him in. “Give me twenty minutes and I’ll send you an address. Odds are, he’s being held there.”

“How–” but it’s Chay’s *life* in the balance and options are few. Who knows what they’ve done to him already? So what if this is absolutely *convenient* and more than likely a trap? What options does he have? “All right, Vegas.” He has to physically unclench his jaw, “Let’s see what you come up with.”

“Got it. Hang tight, Porsche. I’ll get you what you need.”

The line goes dead and the implications don’t make him feel the least bit better.

The address is a warehouse in a seedy location five miles from their home, closer to the compound. Porsche hates backtracking, but he’s not someone that drives the suggested limit anyway.

The trap is annoyingly obvious, but here he is, looking across the dirt to his Chay, unconscious against a crate full of drugs or guns. He can’t work the ropes in plain sight of Vegas, his people, and *shockingly enough*, Tawan.

(And Porsche. Porsche did *not* see that one coming. Sure, Vegas has more than one face, but to hold on to Kinn’s dead *ex* all this time? That’s real dedication to being an asshole, and to this fucked-up *game* Korn and Gun play with their sons’ lives.)

The drama unfolds miraculously (*“This wasn’t in the fucking plan!”* Oh, so many things make sense now. So. Many. Things.) and takes enough attention away from him that he can loosen the ropes enough to escape when the time is right and make a plan. The thug closest to him would go down with a right hook and kick to the knee, giving Porsche a gun and a human shield, but Chay is too exposed out here. Once the bullets start flying, he can’t guarantee his little brother won’t be hurt in the crossfire.

He tries not to get sucked in to Vegas’ crap, keep Chay in his peripheral, but he can’t help but feel oddly satisfied for Kinn’s sake when \**gasp*\* Vegas turns on Tawan, the sound of the gunshot loud but not enough to wake Chay.
