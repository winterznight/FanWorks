From Jotter Pad and the original Fracture verse before shit changed.

This… Really not the way he would prefer to do this, but after everyone he's dated or slept with just, you know, died, this is the safest way possible.

## Clubbing

Not that he's anticipating or even in it 100% (if Kon and Bart were here, they'd tell him he needs this. He needs this kind of connection to another person, needs stress relief, needs to do something…). But, to get annoyingly, well-meaning people OFF HIS FUCKING BACK, he'd give it a shot.

So, down in Gotham with the pseud, a less obvious Draper character, the street kid with a bad attitude, and he's in the underground techno club, close to the bar, sipping on something that looks potent, but is spectacularly not so.

The crowd is hitting the peak, throwing themselves across the dance floors to someone trying to be Steve Aoki. In between his bad boy having a drink moment, he does go out and take in the music, letting it move him, being swept up with the crowd. The smell and sweat, the bodies pressing close to him, the heat and straining muscle, all of it is a heady combination (and so okay, Cassie, maybe he did need a night off). And he can just let himself go with them, move and stretch his body into something other than fighting or training.

A girl, glass in one hand half full of something pink, comes from his peripheral and doesn't bother talking over the pounding bass and beats. She steps into him, fitting a leg between his, free arm lying over his shoulder as she moves with his tempo.

He goes with it, gripping her non-existent hips with one hand, the other prepared in case she's all about trying to pick him clean.

Luckily (since some higher power, you know, like Supes or something), he doesn't need to bring out the vigilante and moves them against the jostling bodies. She isn't interested in talk, just the dance. She fades away just as fast as she appeared- the metaphor for his life. Seriously.

He falls back, planning on making another trip to the bar (maybe for the real thing this time because he really should be working on the latest round of data sets from-)

A hand on his back stops him from retreating, and the vigilante urge is stopped just in the knick of time (terrible way to blow the pseud)

## Companionship: NSFW Tim/OC with some angsty bats later on

*A comment a looong time ago stirred this idea that I never followed through with. It was a little something to the tune of ‘what is Tim’s sex life like in Fracture? He’s not actively dating and he’s terrified of being with someone because, you know, people died all around him. So the idea was he just had a person outside his life that he called when he needed release. Someone who has figured out certain...ah, kinks. *

And, well, it's about that time, isn't it? He's been putting it off for too long, just trying to keep busy (not that it's hard or anything), but well…

And every time is an internal debate on everything from ethics to responsibility, but as per usual, he finally makes the call.

The voice on the other end is oddly relieved even though he made sure this whole arrangement is understood.

"Hey. I'm glad to hear from you. It's… it's been a while."

"I know." Red replies. "Crime waits for no vigilante."

The laugh is nice. His sense of humor is what really makes this easier than it should be.

"Are you in Gotham? I mean I'd like to help you if I can." And Red reads 'if you let me.' Even though the owner of said voice already know Red will never trust, will always run security and have a plan, still there's never hesitation.

"Yeah. I'm in town."

"Okay. Okay. Good. Text me the details okay? You can hack my phone later and erase it anyway."

Like he didn't already plan on it. Seriously?

"All right."

"Don't forget, okay?"

"I'll set everything up."

"Okay. Is there anything you need me to bring?"

"I'll have anything I might need."

"Okay. Red?"

"Hm?"

"Do you- do you need me to say it? I can, okay?" And the voice is softer, deeper so close to-

Red closes his eyes and just, dammit, fucking dammit. Anything that has any sway over him should be a point of contention. This is one of the very few. "Yes."

A significant pause and then- "I've got you, little brother. It's okay." And a slight deepening, "Baby Bird, I'll catch you."

And…fuck. That's just- a fine shudder works up his spine because that's- so wrong and yet so effective.

"Better?" The voice asks gently.

"…yeah," he finally admits. "I'll text you the deets."

"Okay, Red. I'll see you soon."

He hangs up already starting with the recriminations and all the 'what ifs' and 'this isn't healthy' and 'oooh asking for trouble' in his brain pan…but, it isn't going to stop him, is it?

Because Red always takes every precaution, is always careful, and, well, obvi, he always has a plan for some crazy shit going down.

\*\*

He sends the set-up from a burner phone. Allows twenty minutes and perches outside the building, waiting on the fire escape.

He has a trail mix bar with a Zesti and pops a mint afterwards.

Punctually, the light in the room across the way turns on for approximately five minutes. The cameras pre-set show him nothing spectacular, give no indication of a a set-up or anything out of the ordinary.

Red watches every move with intent.

The lights finally go out, and he moves.

The window, of course, is left open, and he cautiously slides in, ducking below the sill, strafing around the shadows on silent feet, checking the small bathroom and closet left purposefully open.

As usual, he stands up when he gets to the foot of the bed, the illusion of appearing.

The late-twentyish man on the bed gives a small jump (even though he probably should have known better by now).

"Red?"

"It's me." In his low, deeper voice, Red stands a second longer before he moves, already touching the place on his domino to raise the lenses. The answering sigh is more relieved than anything because, you know, Gotham.

"I was starting to get worried about you," and the soft glow from the signs outside highlight the lines of his face, emphasize the dark, dark blue of his eyes, the relaxed lines of his body against the bed. His features so striking, so similar to both- nope, not going there again. Really, is there any other reason he does this?

Without needing to be asked, the man on the bed lays back and lifts his hands up, putting his wrists between the slats of the headboard, rote.

Red knows he's smirking (since, well, he really knows how to pick 'em) even as the zip ties come out from the utility belt.

"I'm okay." He gives in just a little, "been a long few months."

And a huff that's probably annoyance. "I keep telling you," those blue eyes so much like- "I like being able to do this for you, Red. You don't need to hesitate."

One hand stills before he gets the zip tie around the wrist.

"It isn't…right. This." He bites out, "I got you out of the life and this just-"

"And I'm a teacher now because of you," those eyes pin him in place. "This isn't hooking, Red. I want you. I want to help you. I want to give you what you need. And… maybe I want this to stay sane in my own life, too? It's not easy sometimes even if it's better. Just…don't wait until you're half crazy. I'm serious."

And the fingers grip his hand through the gloves to emphasize the point.

With the lenses up, he can meet that gaze, give something away. "I get it. I…thanks."

The zip ties go on. Precaution. This happens before… He steps into the shadows, deactivating the security traps. The harness and utility belts, the outer layer of armor, all of it comes off, leaving him vulnerable. In the bodysuit, Red leaves his belts on the stand by the bed, a contingency and takes out the lube and condoms. A pack special wipes for after.

He sits gingerly by the man laying out for him, gauntlets off, gloves on.

Now that he's here, looking down at those eyes, seeing another person, other people, Red reaches out to run the smooth leather over the jaw line and down, eyes following the movement of his fingers over bare skin, over collarbone and chest, thumbing the nipple just a little to hear the intake of breath, the gaspy little noises to signal the start of heat…

And he's leaning down, lips and tongue, gentle bite of teeth on that sweet curve of bone between the shoulders and chest.

And because this isn't a new thing or person (shit, it wasn't even in that realm, right?), he's got the inside scoop on all the spots that will start a chain reaction, begin them down the right road to a mutually beneficial ending.

And then.

"Baby Bird," is rasped out at the lower octave that's almost-

Red just tongues the nipple already in his mouth, rolling his eyes up so the man under him can see…

\*\*

Much later, after Red has let himself recover and takes the special wipes to clean the evidence off the man beneath him,taking his time with it. For both of them really since the pulse under his hands is still fast.

He listens to the pillow talk, making noises of attention, laughing slightly when he holds the wrists, rubbing the marks away with both hands. And classes are going well, he likes this semester, working on a Master's thesis and it's slow going…

He's already in the bodysuit by the time he cuts the ties but still-

Sitting up, eyes still slightly glazed over from the last few rounds, the man smiles a little sadly. "There's…new ones."

Red just grins a little, still rubbing the other wrist.

"Yeah…a couple bullets, but it's okay. I'm healed up."

The free hand comes slowly, gingerly to trace the meat of his thigh where the knife sank in on the last big one (really, All-Hands on deck kind of), and even though he tenses, he allows the touch.

"I know you save a lot of people. Personal experience," is murmured in the dark, "but it's so dangerous. Please just…be careful? As much as you can be?"

Red smiles a little and he knows it can be seen in the neon lights. "I'm trying to be more careful. The team is getting on me more these days."

"…ah, and Batman? You were in the paper…working with him."

Red gives a slowly nod, finally releasing the wrist. "Batman…he's working with me a little more these days when I'm in town."

Fingers touch the back is his gloved hand, "I'm glad. You need as many people at your back as you can get, Red."

He has to laugh a little sadly because, well, being reconditioned is really a bitch.

"Thanks," and he means it.

"Have… Have you-like at all? I mean you called me so I can probably guess-"

"No," he inserts gently. "They have each other. It's…better this way."

"You've gotten closer to them."

"…yes. They… Wanted me closer to the Bats. It's fine. For the best."

Gently, a kiss is pressed to the top of his head and damn it if it doesn't make him think of-

Nope.

"I'm going to go shower. You already-?"

And rote. The steps for afterward Red set out in the beginning when they started this thing. "Yeah, the soap is already in there."

The smile is lopsided, full of mirth and satisfaction that has little to do with sex. The next kiss is placed on his mouth (a rule they break every so often), and as chaste as it is for what they just did for the last few hours, it's nice. Really nice.

While the shower runs, Red removes his cameras, sweeps the room, sprays the sheets with his special concoction, wipes down the rest, and dresses in the rest of his suit.

On the final check in the second drawer of the nightstand…he finds it and-

Fuck.

He should have checked more thoroughly before-

Mother. Fucking. Shit.

His pulse hammers in the back of his mouth as Red gingerly takes the bug and pockets it.

No markings. It could be Ra's for all he knows.

Red sets up another hotel room from the same burner phone hurriedly, gets the handsome man out of the shower, and dries him off quickly.

"I've been found out." He explains starkly and those eyes widen. "I have a place where you'll be safe while I track this, make sure it's not a bad guy, okay?"

A hand wraps around his wrist. "Red?"

"I won't let anyone hurt you." He promises.

"It might be them?"

"I'm not going to bet your life on it. I have enemies. Dangerous ones."

He's sitting on the bed while Red searches his clothes thoroughly, every seam, every stitch.

No tracers.

The cell phone is next.

Even without a laptop, he cracks the encryption and-

Shit.

Red curses harshly, making the other jump a little. Red moves to the window and-

A flash in the shadows. He only sees it because yeah, expert here.

"Okay. Give me a second."

"You know-"

"Oh yeah. Someone is getting an ass kicking for this." He taps his comm while his other fist tightens.

"Red, O here."

He rattles off a line of code. "Deets. Now."

"That doesn't sound good," she replies mildly. "Someone making you a pissy panda, Red?"

"Someone is nosing where they don't fucking belong. Who?"

"You already know." She guesses shrewdly, and yeah, he's at the side of the window looking out at the vigilantes watching the room.

"So everyone knows." And that's a hard, angry observation.

"No. I'm not even sure who the guy is. Are you undercover? Red, I can call in the Bats."

"No. Nothing like that. Remove the tracking software, O. Now."

"Red-"

"Not a case. Remove. It."

A hand lightly on him and Red turns, but his company just moves past him, in front of the window, naked, stretching out his muscles and putting himself on display.

Fuck.

"Oh." And shit. "Okay then. I'm removing the code. You could have just said."

"My business. I used a burner phone for a reason, you know."

And the hand on his shoulder pulls just enough to get him in the window frame before the taller man is lowering his head to violate the rule again and the kiss is dirty, obvious.

What the fuck?

A laugh against his mouth, "play along. One of your guys, right?"

"Yes, they won't-" hurt you is muffled around the tongue in his mouth. Red raises a hand to the back of his neck, turning him slightly because yeah, you assholes. This is what you get.

\*\*\*

Something else from the old Fracture Verse

## Confessional (Dick/Tim)

Gently, lightly, like the brush of a bird's wing, his fingertips stroke the back of the other man's hand. The breath in his lungs aches when the words start to pour out, a confession hoping for salvation.

"I felt like a brother to Robin…but Tim Drake is the one that attracted me," Dick admits gently. "It was…wrong. I knew it. You were so young, too young, and in incredible pain after everyone kept leaving you. But, my God, so strong to keep moving like that. Just, next thing on the list. The next big bad. You kept standing up, Tim, and how much I wanted to just be more to you, that you could see me like that…"

Lying on the medical bed in the Cave, the unconscious man doesn't make a sound.

"I thought… I'd beaten it. This attraction thing when you started pulling away after-after Dami took up the R. And, yeah he did need it, but… But Timmy, the line between you and Robin was blurring too much for me back then. You were so close and I was just…God, I was in hell." Dick's voice come close to breaking. "I was so lost myself having to take on Batman and you and Dami and all I wanted was to…you don't even know."

The older man sits back, hands over his face. "I couldn't… I couldn't have you as my Robin and want you this much. It would have broken everything. I knew it. I hated it but I knew it. Still, i was tempted, ao fucking tempted to just keep you in that role and… Well, every Batman needs a Robin. Heh. Yeah, I didnt even know how much I needed you until you were gone and letting you go was so hard. But dammit, if any of it had gone wrong, I'd lose you entirely and there's no way I could let that happen..and, it just did anyway, didn't it?"

He sighs and looks over at the younger man, face slack in unconsciousness, breathing deep, sleeping easily, without nightmares for once. And that makes Dick Grayson satisfied, gives him the needed courage to reach out gingerly, run the tips of his fingers through the longer waves of hair.

"I'll do better now, this time. I'm not going to push you away because of it again." He promises gently. "Jay and I both will do the right thing. We agreed, okay? We talked about it. About how we both just fucking want you- so much sometimes. But, we can get over it. We can ignore it Timmy, for you. It's… it's not going to be easy for us because well, it's you. And, we watch you move and we watch how you think and how you are just so…Tim. And you're not a kid anymore, you're this powerful, intelligent man. And you fight with your whole heart, you give everything, but we're going to do this. We're going to be the brothers you need us to be, okay?"

And the silent footsteps don't shake him a bit, but he does stop rambling on about all these things he'd kept to himself for too long.

"I don't ever want to lose you again." Is the last thing before Jay slides an easy hand over his shoulder and curls the arm around his collar bone. Dick catches red out of his peripheral.

"Didn't think you were Catholic, babe," the guy whispers playfully, nosing against Dick's neck.

And that earns a laugh, a small, genuine one, so a win.

"Not a Catholic, Jay. Most Romanis are pagan heathens anyway. Didn't anyone ever tell you?"

Now Jay's laughing softly against his cheek, real and warm.

"Hey, whatever makes it good at the end of the day… Feel better now?"

"Ha. Not like I can ever tell him while he's awake."

"I know we agreed, Big Wing. But you never know, kid might just be flattered. Two vigilante bad asses after him."

"Maybe… I don't want him to just leave and stop coming back. The first time was bad enough."

"Yeah. Didn't realize how much I missed seeing him, hanging out without the masks until he…wasn't there. It's nuts. Him n’ us, you know?"

"Well, you were his Robin, right?"

"Aw, don't be jealous. We'll both give em a pair of those scaly panties and be done with it."

And Dick snickers, grins softly, sadly, "not jealous, Little Wing. Wistful maybe. A lot of things I should have done differently- with both of you."

"Hn," the other man breathes against his neck just because he knows the effect. "The road is hard, and that's okay, Dick. The end though, where we end up is what matters."

## First Damaged Goods: **Read this Warning**:

*The White Triad sexually assaulted Tim in the original Fracture storyline, but I changed my mind not very far into it, probably before Chapter 7. You can see it up until there if you squint. This thing references that assault and turns into NSFW. It’s a hard read and could be triggering.*

(Dick/Tim) Strange combination of angst, rape aftermath, and experimentation.

Just staring at Tim made him better because the changes are now so much more obvious. He's upstairs at the table, eating with them, still in the suit he wore to WE that day. He and Dami are in heavy conversation since Alfred took the crime scene photos and lab reports away, claiming it was not couth for the dinner table. Tim had grinned unrepentant, Dami looked annoyed.

"But Pennyworth! He's teaching me!"

"Lessons such as this are not for the table, Master Damian."

Tim had laughed to himself, looking happier, lighter than he had in months. he still worked himself into exhaustion once and a while, still ran for the Titans, still stayed in his own apartment most of the time, and still had his own agenda, but this is the closest he'd been to the family in too long. Even Jason was over more, his old room changed to include his subscription to Guns & Ammo, new books he bought for his nights off, new clothing, extra 'suits.' It seemed he, too, decided to come home.

Dick, like Bruce, is satisfied…almost. He is still thrumming with things that need to be said, things he kept locked up within himself to keep them both safe…

It's time and Dick is sweating proverbial bullets.

Dinner is over, coffee gone, and Tim is putting his suit coat on while laughing at something Jason is saying, shaking his head in mirth. He makes Dick feel warm, looking at that easy expression in comparison to the blank, empty mask he'd been using for so long without them realizing it.

"I'll take you," Dick waves off Alfred, who hasn't even taken off his apron yet but gives Dick a grateful nod.

"Thank-you, Master Dick. I, of course, don't mind, however-"

"Your work is never done. You're the man behind the Bat, Al."

"Very much so, Master Tim."

The younger man grins and makes his good byes (not before Dami extracts a promise for the answers to the cold case this week and Jason whining that HE gets to patrol with Red Robin some time in the next century) then follows Dick to the garage.

The two fall into easy conversation; Tim at ease and somewhat open in his presence, laughing with him and telling stories making his heart lighter with every mile. They're almost back to the relationship they had way back when, snarking and teasing, Tim dealing with his casual touches and surprise hugs. Good-natured ribbing that comes dangerously close to flirting on Dick's part just because he's…

"Okay, okay, stop," but Tim is laughing, eyes dancing with mirth. "You're killing me with this underoo versus thong thing. Seriously, who can fight crime with a string in the ass? I can't kick someone teeth out when my balls are being strangled. Just, no."

Now, Dick is laughing, face in his hand, arm propped on the steering wheel while he chorts.

"And Wally? Take your time with that. He's going to have burnt dental floss under that onsie? I'll never buy it."

Holding his side now, he's ready to beg for mercy, "stop… God, please stop. I'm dying, Tim." Just the image makes him start up again, and that little shit feels no remorse whatsoever, grinning at him.

"All right, all right, I'm done. Promise." Holding up both palms, placating, he stays true to his word.

Dick can finally look at his face without crying, but he does point a finger at the younger man, "you are such a little wise ass."

There's that genuine grin again, "me? Seriously? Like I didn't take notes?"

"That's our real super power, you know."

"Witty banter really make them quake in their evil guy shoes, Dick."

And, they're outside the apartment, have been for fifteen minutes or more and Dick finally take the plunge.

"We do what we can, right? But, hey… Can I come up for a few?"

"Depends," Tim arches a brow, "if you can work my coffee maker without breaking it, you're in."

"I'll do my best to maintain the honor of our ancestors."

"You're a shit, grasshopper. C'mon, I'm all about getting out of this suit." Tim opens the door and misses the suddenly intent look on Dick's face as those words play for him in a completely different context.

It's worse because he's following the younger man up the steps and watching the sway of his hips, catching the curve of his ass under the jacket, eyes moving over the width of shoulders and back that had grown, filled out in the last two years. It takes effort but Dick reins himself back in with a quiet, deep breath as Tim unlocks the door and disarms the security system.

Tim is already pulling his jacket off, saying "lights, 50%." The windows are blacked out already and Dick just ambles over to the kitchen while pointedly not watching Tim disappear down the hallway, dress shirt coming off before he hit the doorway. Instead, he focuses on making regular old coffee (instead of that espresso crap Dami likes).

He kicks his shoes off and stretches out on Tim's couch, feet propped up on his coffee table and just breathes, closing his eyes to muster up his courage and lightly meditate with the old techniques Bruce taught him a lifetime ago.

"Hey, you can crash in my room. Bed is softer."

Tim's gentle voice makes him blink and he's in the usual sweats/t-shirt combo, carrying two mugs. The one he sets down beside Dick's feet is done with the old school Robin motif, and it makes him grin. He's got a mug at Tim's again. It's a win.

He's smiling as the younger man sits at the other corner against the arm, facing Dick rather than the television, smiling gently.

"Okay, Big Wing, what's going on?"

Mid-sip, Dick's eyebrows go up. "What makes you think something's up?"

"I know you." Tim's eyes become shrewd, "and you gave me a ride because you need to talk. Well, here I am." Tim waves him on, "you and Babs have a fight?"

Dick just laughs a little, "no. Nothing like that, baby bird."

"Then what's going on?" Tim's voice is soft, "you can tell me, I won't judge."

Sigh. "Don't say that yet." He leans forward a little to put his face in his hands.

"It's fine. Out with it."

Deep breath, "to be perfectly fair, I had the best of intentions at the time. I wanted to do it all right, so I could have told you this back then. But, everything went down hill so fast and… Well, I took Robin away because there was no way I could be the Batman and have these feelings for my Robin. It-it wouldn't have worked and I knew it. Once Dami became Robin and you took on another identity, I could have dealt with it. I'm supposed to be like a brother to you, Tim, and it was just inappropriate. But it's not going to affect how much I love you and how happy I am to be back in your life and-"

"Take a breath."

He does, not looking at Tim.

"I'm not trying to make this weird for you or anything but I did want you to know I had good reasons at the time. I just wish I had done everything right by you, that I hadn't let you just go. But I can promise this isn't going to change anything, Tim. I swear. I'm still here for you."

"Then explain something to me," Tim finally breaks in.

"Okay."

"You said you couldn't be the Batman with 'these feelings' for Robin. What are those feelings?"

Yup, he is going to make Dick say it, make him feel more like a pervert then he already did.

"I'm…attracted to you, but like I said-"

"When did this start?"

This… This is not where he expected Tim to go with this and finally looks at the younger man. His expression is blank, unconcerned while holding his coffee.

"Tim-"

"Answer the questions, Dick." But he doesn't sound angry per say.

"It started getting more noticeable right before Bruce went missing," he admits to himself, "you were only seventeen and everything about you did me in, I guess. The way you think, the way you fight for what's yours with your whole heart, the way you smile before you take the first jump off into the night, how good you feel against me when I carry you, when I can just laugh with you about stupid shit… all of that and who you are now as an adult. I just- I can't let myself, Tim. I want you to trust me again, not put you in a crazy position-"

"I gave up on you, you know."

It's so quiet, Dick has to convince himself he really heard that.

"In the beginning, when I came to you and not Bruce. There was a reason."

"Steph…?"

Tim just shrugs, "it always comes back to you. Steph figured it out a long time ago."

And-and, holy shit.

Tim sighs, but it's not a happy sound. "A year ago this would have made my life," and he's looking out the blackened windows with something so broken in his expression that Dick straightens. "The one thing I've always wanted you to say, so I didn't have to think this was all just one-sided, that you took me seriously." He laughs sadly, "fucking timing."

Very carefully, gently Dick repeats, "a year ago?"

Tim closes his eyes, "they… When they had me, they wanted to break me, Dick."

And now his heart is pounding at the implications, at what Tim is trying to say.

"I'm damaged goods now," and the younger man turns to meet his eyes and give a wistful little smile and shrug like it's his fucking fault, like he's sorry he got forced because none of them came to SAVE HIM IN TIME. "Sorry."

Dick isn't even aware he's moving until he registered Tim is breathing into his neck and his arms, his hands are full of warmth and muscle and neck and pressing that perfect person into him so Dick can try (too late) to protect him.

"Don't ever say that. Don't EVER SAY THAT AGAIN."

Tim sighs, completely unruffled, unaffected by what he believes is fact. "It's the truth, Dick. I won't lie about it-" 'to you.'

"Bullshit, Tim." The octopus hold is engaged and Tim knows he's in for it. "They didn't make you anything but stronger. They didn't break you, they couldn't break you," and Dick's breath stirs the fine hairs at the back of his neck, making him shudder with old want and desire. "You're still YOU, still the detective, still the funny guy I can snark with, still the guy that gives with his whole heart. Still the guy I want with everything I am. None of that changes, Timmy. None of that."

Tim is rigid in his hold, breathing shakily,"Sex…is hard for me. I haven't…Since then, I haven't been able to, haven't really wanted to try, you know?"

"It's understandable, Tim. Jesus, give yourself some time to heal and-"

"It's been almost a year," Tim deadpans, "I've-I just keep hitting a wall and I can't go through with it. It's…frustrating."

"Don't force it. You will when the time is right, when the person is right."

Another laugh from Tim that has nothing to do with humor. "It's so messed up. I'm messed up. I want it to be with you, more than anything, but at the same time, I don't want you to see. I don't want to infect you." He clenches his fists is Dick's shirt to try and stop his fists from shaking. He's tainted, damaged, and Dick is so good, so pure, so full of heart that he can't, could never bring himself to-

"I can't…"

Dick pulls back enough to see his face, one hand spanning the side of his throat, tilting his face up enough to-

And oh God. Oh. God. This is… This is really happening right now. Dick's mouth is soft and unassuming, softer than in Tim's imagination, pressing perfectly against his, slanting just right to brush their lower lips together.

Dick pulls back too soon, and Tim cannot, for the life of him, open his eyes to see what expression might be there. Instead, he lays his forehead against the older man's and breathes out shakily.

"Dammit," he says after a second of Dick's thumb tracing his lips. The motion stills. "This is my life right now." And his courage finally kicks on for him to open his eyes and bring both hands to that face, watching those blue, blue eyes when he closes in this time, giving him the chance to pull away. When Dick's eyes just flick down to his mouth, Tim makes a small noise of want and presses them together again. With his lips and tongue, he opens Dick's mouth under his and sweeps his tongue inside because he can taste and smell and touch this man. After so much causing the rift, making him think this was just a pipe dream, he's going to have something to remember.

The wet slide and Dick's tongue against his wrings another noise out of him, one the other man swallows and apparently wants more of since his hands come up to move along Tim's spine, to move down and massage long fingers in his hips, makes obscene rolls of his own hips up to rub them together. Tim gasps in Dick's mouth and rolls his hips in tandem.

They both realize what they're doing at the same moment and pull away, Tim scrambling back on the arm, red-faced and Dick back against the other arm, mouth wet and breathing harder.

"I swear this is not how I meant tonight to go," Dick starts, "I mean not this far. I thought you'd be freaked, angry, but I never imagined this, okay? This is…wow. Just wow."

Trying to be subtle, Dick tries to adjust in his jeans, also trying not to be caught staring at Tim's obvious hard-on in his sweats, but he can't help it, the want wells up inside him, the old lust for this man just breathes down his spine, making him roll to his knees and stare.

Tim utters a noise at that look, the expression, like Dick is a predator stalking him, ready to pounce, and Tim just licks his lips, tries to think while those blue, blue eyes watch the motion.

"H-how about an…experiment?"

The brows go up, waiting.

"We can test this, see how far I can go." His voice is so much calmer than he feels right now. "If…if it's too much, can you-"

"Yes." Dick immediately answers the underlying question. "You say 'Stop' and we stop."

Tim let's out a long breath, "okay."

Dick hesitates a second,"would it be better for you if I was… If i couldn't move?"

At Tim's questioning look, Dick holds his wrists together behind his back, that predatory look still in those eyes.

Tim's pupils dilate, "I think that would…help. Are you comfortable-?"

"I know you won't hurt me." Dick replies gently.

That's enough for him, he rolls to his feet and holds out a hand without another word.

The older man smiles and takes it, letting Tim pull him to his feet, lead him down the hall with one warm hand on his, holding tight. Dick takes a breath.

Tim sits him down on the foot of the bed and goes to the closet. Dick can hear the opening of the harness, tries to get his breath at what may lie in store for him, tied down so Tim can…do whatever he wants.

He's pressing into the zipper of his jeans again, biting his lip hard to keep himself in control. This was going to be torture but for Tim, he'd do it.

The black zip ties in his fist make Dick's cock throb, but he just bites his lip and waits for what the younger man wants. He makes his hands lay by his thighs on the bed spread.

Tim's eyes are calm, dark but there's something underneath he can almost see…

He's got a lap full, the zip ties beside him so Tim can hold his face with both hands, use his thumbs to tip Dick up and he gets to taste again, gets to feel the wet glide of lips and tongue. Gets to turn slightly to press them closer together. He gets hands in his hair, fingernails gently raking against his scalp, he gets little noises to swallow and echo, he gets to suck that tongue into his own mouth.

He shudders when Tim finally pulls back, looking at the pink in his cheeks and messily undone. The younger ducks his head into Dick's neck and mouths at the tendon, bites gently, just enough for Dick's hips to twitch up abruptly. It earns a laugh against his skin, the best sound.

Tim's hands are at the hem of his old Gotham Knights shirt, sliding under.

"Wanna see you, okay?"

The strangled noise from this throat is probably consent enough because those hands are warm against his ribs, his side, brush up over his nipples, and the shirt is up and off before he can get his fill of that touch.

To make himself keep his hands off until Tim gives him the okay, Dick leans back and his elbows, putting himself on display with carved muscles and his share of scarred skin. He has no illusions about his looks, never has (the costume is a second skin almost, mostly to cut out wind resistance but no one needed to know that). He's a former acrobat, a vigilante, keeping himself in shape (as well as to keep old injuries moving) is a huge part of the game.

Other heroes have come on to him (many, many times) and he could joke about his looks all day, about what his body is capable of doing. Kori always told him he was handsome and built, Wally always touched him when no one else was looking, and Babs actually liked it when he carried her around when she didn't tolerate it from anyone else. He's more flexible than most people and everyone that had ever hit on him (as Dick Grayson, as Robin, as Nightwing) wanted to know the extents. He'd always have some quip ready even when the questions got old, when he wanted to tell whoever they'd never find out. They saw the body, not the person.

But until he sees the appreciation, the anticipation in Tim's eyes, he didn't really get it. Just that look when Tim's eyes slide up his bare skin to his gaze makes him shiver a little under the scrutiny.

Tim slides off his lap and starts at the waist line with hands, thumbs rubbing, fingers splaying wide. The muscles jump, strain under his fingers, and Dick arches for him. His head falls back, stretching his neck out to be just a line of corded muscle. The hands feel him out, not even tentative, but firm and calculating, looking for his sensitive spots, ones that made him react the way Tim wanted.

He's breathing hard before the mouth follows, tracing his belly, his abs, up his side, drawing noises from him with bites and suction. By the time Tim is to his nipples, his forearms are clenched, chest heaving under Tim's. He aches.

Then Tim mouths him there, those sensitive nubs, while he watches the reaction he elicits, eyes almost violet with how dark they are. Dick can't hold it in, a harsh cry comes from deep in his chest, body arching hard under Tim's.

"Oh…my God."

The hand sweeps up his sides again and Tim's voice is hoarse, rough with arousal.

"Fuck this is perfect." He dives back for more skin, talking against the wet nub, breathing over it, "you’re beautiful, Dick. Mesmerizing."

He laughs a little to cover up how Tim's word effect him but with their hips pressing together, it's obvious.

"You have no idea," he moans when Tim sucks the other nub in the warm wet of his mouth. "That's what I think of you just in general."

Tim's chest and belly quake with his laughter, but the mouth still sucks him in deeper.

"Fuuuck. I'm being so good right now," he pants, "I deserve a medal for this, I swear, Tim. God, this might kill me."

Tim sucks more, tongue wrapping around the nub. Hips start to move against his, and God, that's hot too. He shudders again and swivels his hips in circles to use the hard denim against Tim's erection. The grunt against his skin tells him it's working and Dick smirks a little. His legs come up, spilling the shorter man against him, leaning down so he can capture Tim's mouth again.

Tim sighs gently, twining his tongue around Dick's, fingers and palms still moving over skin, warming him.

Until one passes against the bulge in his pants and starts with the rubbing. The noise that comes out of him is pained, agony.

"Ah. I like that," Tim says against his throat with a small laugh, his voice deeper against the sensitive skin that Dick gasps. "You need that, don't you?"

"Yess," Dick's head goes back, mouth open.

"Me too, but I need you to move up." His arm is already wound around Dick's mid back and Tim lifts his upper body without any strain, simply crawling further up the bed with Dick in tow.

Tim lays him against the pillows, leans down to nose at the tendon, then lathe the skin with his tongue and lips.

"You still sure about this?" With his face hidden, Tim can ask again. To make sure because he-he understood.

The breathless laugh rumbles against his chest, "anything for you, Baby Bird. I can take it."

Tim hums against skin, hand going for one forearm to lift the wrist by the headboard, squeezing the wrist gently. He lifts himself up enough to press his mouth to the scar along Dick's forearm. Tongue tracing the white line, making Dick gasp when he mouthed the inner flesh of that wrist, tasting, licking, nibbling, distracting him so he wouldn't feel the zip tie until it tightened on the reinforced metal bar of the headboard.

Dick's eyes go a shade darker and he automatically strains just enough to test the hold; Tim didn't pause but lifts the other hand to press his mouth against old scars with reverence. He takes his time to give the arm the same treatment while the hips under him swivel and the muscles under his hand tremble minutely from the attention (the inner elbows and wrists are hot spots; he would find more). The second tie tightens before Dick even realizes it. The hands and mouth are back, tongue teasing the straining muscles of his shoulders and down to come back to the tight bud of his nipples. The mouth pauses there but the hands keep moving down, sliding, rubbing, memorizing his body in a sensual dance.

The button on his jeans pop, fingers on the inside of his boxers, thumbs finding the jut of his hip and oh God, how did he know that place is so sensitive?!

Tim's mouth is sliding down, feathering kisses over his sides and sucking, biting at him like the taste is heady.

"Lift your hips for me, Dick. Let me see you."

Nodding because he's so hot, his hands wrap around the metal bars he's tied to and arches his back to lift his lower body completely up.

Tim's hands are shaky against his mid-back.

"Baby Bird?" He lowers himself back down before the jeans get lowered and pulls himself up to look at Tim on his knees between Dick's spread thighs, too much dark hair covering his face. "Tim, babe. Look at me. Please."

The younger does, eyes heavy lidded.

"It's okay," Dick's voice is gentle, "you have nothing to prove, not with how strong you already are. Don't push yourself."

And Tim, a smile splits his face, a rush of heat to his neck and cheeks. "That's… That's not it," he assures with a small laugh, scratching the back of his neck nervously (and there's the hint of the guy he remembers, the one that was always honest with him).

"I'm just really--turned on," deep and breathless, the voice works its way down Dick's spine. "Never thought I'd get this chance and fuck I could just take hours to make those noises come out of you over and over," and Tim's hands slide up his sides again, spanning his abdomen, body moving in a graceful arch over Dick. His eyes are so dark, holding Dick's gaze captive. "I want to see you lose your mind because of me, buried in the back of my throat or deep inside me when you come. Fuck, I want that."

This time, his hand are at Dick's mid-back, working the jeans down enough to palm his ass.

"God, Tim. Dirty talk is so sexy, you know."

"Not talk," the younger counters, working more denim down while his eyes take in bared skin "fact. Always been you, remember?"

The older man laughs gently as those hands massage him, ending in a groan. "Not one-sided, Tim. Fuck, I watch you move in that uniform and have to think of baseball and Bruce in a bikini and-" his jeans slide down to his thighs with Tim's fingers and the air hits his hard cock like a breath, making him hiss through his teeth.

"So, you like the Red Robin uniform, do you?" Tim slides denim further down without looking at anything but below the waistline, pupils slightly dilated. Dick raises his legs to help and he's bare under Tim's hot gaze.

"Yes," the voice coming from him his deeper, slightly hoarse. "You're in it, you. My Tim under the harness and cape and cowl."

Fingers on the tops of his feet, sliding up to the ankle, finding the sensitive bone and tracing over it. Palms on his shins, moving to calves, kneading the heavy muscles.

Dick closes his eyes, bites his lip, as warmth mouths at the bend of his knee, sucking at the tender spot. His leg twitches automatically, but the mouth keeps moving, the hands gliding, mapping his thighs like Tim wants to feel every inch of skin he can. His fingers caress over old scars (where, when?)and his tongue lathes them in warmth and heat.

Finally, his breath over the base of Dick's cock, and the elder pulls against his bonds, gasping. All the exploration of his body makes him so sensitive to the touch.

"I can't- Dick, I need… Fuck, I'm sorry but I need this."

Brain half working, Dick opens his mouth, going to ask Tim what's wrong, don't do anything that isn't--

But Tim takes him in without much more warning than that, and Dick's whole body arches, he cries out something in French or maybe Latin when warmth, heat, wet envelops him. Tim shudders delicately, hollows his cheeks and sucks.

"Fuck! Oh my God, Tim! Timmy, fuck, fuck!" And his tongue is everywhere, licking up the vein to the head, swirling around his slit, and Dick's legs start shaking, leaning up so he can watch his shiny cock sliding out of Tim's mouth, moaning at just the sight.

He starts panting more as Tim works him, moaning around his cock, sliding wetly along his length without a hitch, tongue and lips working, just the best scrape of teeth to make those noises spill right out of Dick's mouth. Broken groans, gasps, Tim's name with lust and want and need.

And those hands and just slide right under him, the shoulders holding his thighs apart, fingertips over his hips and sides.

"God, Tim. Timmy… I'm, fuck! Ahhh. Please, please. I need, I need…"

And the younger pulls off, "tell me, Dick. What do you need?" And that voice is so deep with his own arousal from doing this, from touching and tasting and fondling and skin.

"Make… Make me come. Please. I want to come for you. Just for you."

"Fuck, Dick. Yesss," and Tim's mouth is on him again, moving faster, wet and insistent. Now there's effort and intent.

And Dick almost screams with it, with the pressure building in his balls, his abdomen, making him almost lose his mind.

Tim pulls off, keeps working him with one hand.

## The Follow-up: Help

*The convo between Dick and Jay*

Jason is just staring, mouth agape and staring. There's just no way. He heard wrong, had to have. No other explanation. That it he went temporarily nuts, straight out Joker fucking crazy.

Yup, that makes more sense, right?

But Dick's face is unusually solemn and there's something more to the story.

"Big Wing," Jason starts, "you can't just ask me that and expect no questions because I already know who you're talking about."

Blue eyes blinked at him.

"Babs would kill you if you she knew you asked me to join you in bed, by the way."

"…not Babs, Little Wing."

A brow rises, "ah. Kory then."

Shake of his dark head.

"Oh… Wally?"

Another shake and then Dick is more serious than Jason had ever seen.

"Someone that's…suffered through some heavy trauma. Someone that was…sexually assaulted and is trying to get back to being able to function." Dick's hands come palm up, "before you say anything, just know I've been trying to help him work through it, taking everything slow and letting him make all the decisions. But, I know he's getting too frustrated with it, so I'm asking for your advice on the subject. Get it?"

And just, fucking Jason. "Big Wing. Those White Triad bastard did it to him. They raped him, didn't they?"

Dick lets out a shaky breath, "fuck. Don't tell him-"

"You came to me because I used to help clean up the girls when their Johns got too rough or didn't take 'no.' I get it, Dick. It's smart of you because I know Tim will never go to therapy."

Jason runs a hand through his hair and just breathes for a minute, and fuck if his chest doesn't just ache for the kid. God, he wants to get so fucking mad on his behalf, wants to rip and tear flesh at the injustice of it all. His hands clench in his hair, giving a hard tug to pull himself out of the madness that's always close enough to shove his hands into…

When he feels like he's not going to lose his shit, he can talk again. "Okay. Oh.Kay. I don't need the hardcore deets if that's not cool with you, but really, Big Wing, couldn't have told me you were dating? Prepared me a little for this?"

"Ah, well…" Now Dick's scratching the back of his neck and now he's uncomfortable. "We aren't 'dating' in the traditional sense, Jaybird. We're just, I don't know, together when we're both in town."

"Soooo. Kind of open, not caging him in. I get that too."

Dick just nods, eyes serious. "Yeah. So, what do you want to know?"

"Whatever you feel you can tell me."

Dick nods and takes a breath himself. "I know they did the more…traditional methods for a while. Waterboarding, beatings, electroshock. The- the-"

"Assault," Jason supplies gently.

"Yeah, the assault started happening last few days before he escaped. It started with one of them, one that, uh, abused some of the kids…I mean. Yeah. Then others. He thinks three others."

Another deep breath for both of them.

"I just wanted him to understand why about the Robin thing. I didn't expect, I didn't know-- I just thought he saw me as his brother, you know? But yeah, he was attracted to me too, so it was really a shock."

"You made him give up Robin because you wanted him, Dick?"

Miserable, the elder nods gently.

Jason just shrugs. "Tactilely sound call."

Dick's face is more surprised than Jason expects, like he's been questioning the decision himself all this time.

"Well, he was pretty stoked that I felt that way, but then he just got all quiet and said he wished I would have told him a year ago before he got kidnapped and…Jay, he fucking called himself damaged goods, acted like he was tainted and he'd 'infect' me or something. I mean-" Dick's voice is getting thick as the words pour out, "and he just smiled all sad and said he was sorry. Like he was sorry some bastards got to him first or something, my God. I just hugged him, I just pulled him right to me and held on, Jay." Dick is just staring down at the table, pain and anger and horror filling his eyes. "I didn't protect him from this. Me and Bruce couldn't save him."

Slowly, Jason's hand crosses the table, fingers wrapping around the other man's forearm, getting those eyes to focus from wherever he's at.

"What did you say to him, Dick?"

"That-That it wasn't true! He's still Tim. He's still strong and smart, he's still a fighter and a leader and one of the best guys ever. Nothing those sons of bitches did could EVER make him less than that. Fuck-"

"You did good, Big Wing. That's exactly what he needed to hear," Jason squeezes the forearm gently but doesn't let go. "His reaction is normal, touching him may have been too far, did he push you away? Freeze up?"

Dick blinks, "no. No, he just hugged me back."

"Okay, that's good. You may have gotten through to him, at least a bit. Now, feel free to be general but, first, who brought up intimacy? How did he react?"

"He was just talking about after it all happened, he wasn't able to go through with it, sex. He was frustrated with himself, and I told him he needed time and the right person and…he said he wanted, he wished it could be with me, and all that shit about 'tainting' me came up again, and I just…I just wanted to prove to him he wasn't- I kissed him."

"Invasive?"

"No! No, I didn't want to traumatize him any more than he already was, but he, uh, he kissed me back." Dick's face heats up a little. "And… He kind of proposed an experiment where we could see how much he could…how far he could comfortably go. When he said stop, we would stop."

Jason sighs, "sounds like Baby Bird. Pushing himself to the limits. Okay. How did it go?"

Dick looks away, "he's fine touching me. He liked it, likes it. He gets me off without even thinking hard, just lets his body take over instead of his head, you know? He gets excited by it, so even that's a win from where he was a month ago, but… Ah, well-"

"Touching him is a different story," Jason deduces correctly.

Dick just nods, still miserable. "It feels wrong to me, like I'm using him instead of trying to help him, be with him. That's…not what I wanted, what I want."

Jason's eyes aren't judging him though, just calm blue pools of understanding, of sympathy.

"How much does he let you touch him? Just general, Big Wing. Nothing that makes you weirded out."

"I'm cool giving the deets, Little Wing. Not bothered if it helps."

## Damaged Goods Remix: OT3 Tim/Dick/Jason

## **Read this Warning:**

*This also mentions Tim being sexually assaulted by the White Triad, but has PTSD symptoms and talking about feelings. Dick and Jay also mention their previous experiences with assault. Sfw content, but *feels*. *

It was a good patrol. Least amount of damage, he and Dami laughing, the little shit finally getting the point of roof tag now that Steph joined in and he had more than one target to catch or evade.

No one seriously hurt. Life is good. So he crawls into his perch at ten till three, body still thrumming with adrenaline and the thrill of flying. To immediately stop when he realizes his perch is compromised and someone is in his bed.

He's almost through the window, the bathroom light illuminating a span of back, wide shoulders and a shock of dark hair sticking all over the place. Red already has a handful of knock-out pellets in case one of the bads found him or one of the overseas really big bads finally came to pay him a visit.

A thousand things are going through his head until the body turns over and the white strands tell him exactly who found his way into Tim Drake's bed. Reds eyes seek out the spot over and, yep, he's right. The other mound isn't blankets, the shadows off Dick Grayson's jaw and cheeks are unmistakable.

So now that he knows no one is coming to kill him, his mind kicks into another direction entirely. He's down out of the window, strafing silently over to the bed looking for injuries, bandages, stitches, glancing through the bathroom for bloody gauze or empty injections from some sort of toxin (because really Ivy, sex pollen? That's every fan girl's wet dream about the Hood or Nightwing. Try something original).

It's the best explanation why they only made it to his bed and not the guest room. He takes off the domino and eases back, content to get out of his uniform and maybe make some coffee to get the chill out of his bones before a shower.

Just as he gets one foot behind him, a hand catches his wrist and Jason's eyes are open in the dim bathroom light, his eyes not as blue as Dick's.

"You two okay?" He whispers so he doesn't wake Dick.

Jason blinks at him with sleepy eyes, "tried to wait up for you, Baby Bird." The hand on his wrist loosens a little, thumb rubbing the underside through his gauntlet.

"Don't even. Go back to sleep." And he can hear the fondness in his own voice, smiling down at his second greatest crush and one of his best friends.

Jason makes a negative noise in the back of his throat. "Me and Dick been talking, Tim," and the low gravel of his voice is losing some of that sleepy, slurring quality, becoming more alert. "That's why we're here tonight."

Tim crouches down to be at eye-level, close so he can lower his voice. His free hand deactivates the security and the cowl comes off. The night vision gone, he's just looking at Jay's half-shadowed face.

"It's all good, Little Wing. It can wait until tomorrow. You two need to sleep, okay?"

"Timmy…" Jason whispers softly, the breath across his face and the look intensifies, becoming something he's never seen before… It's not the look when Jason wanted to kill him or when he pulled Red Robin away from death's door or even the one when they've come off a long night and survived… It's a look from his private collection.

"Jay…?"

Those eyes dart down to look at his mouth and before he can react, Jay is close, pressing his mouth against Tim's, taking advantage of the gasp and slipping his tongue inside. The hand on his wrist tightens, pulls, and Tim goes completely still, frozen.

His mind jerks him back to that ship. To the smell of blood and human stink and three men that held him down while they took their turns and he couldn't even fight back, couldn't risk giving himself away before he had a plan to save those children… His body breaking apart, their laughter, their moans while they used him.

When he comes back to the now, when his mind snaps to the present, his chest is burning and he can't breathe right. Jason and Dick are over him, their faces terrified (when did he fall back… When…?)

He blinks and jerks away, crab walking until his back hits the wall and he can force himself to stop almost hyperventilating. Closes his eyes, shoves his hands in his hair and force himself to calm the fuck down. Dammit. He's shaking like crazy and just, just fuck.

In a few minutes, he's got it enough to open his eyes, making his mind count the number of lines in the carpet, times it by the number of squares, multiply that by the number of rooms…

"Don't touch him yet," Jason is saying, his hearing finally back, his pulse still thumping on the back of his tongue.

"S-Sorry," he manages. "I-I'm sorry."

Dick makes a move but Jason is still gripping his shoulder, holding him back.

"Baby Bird, can you hear me? You with me?" Slowly, like approaching a spooked animal, Jay eases forward, eyes taking in everything.

"I'm sorry," he says again, finally able to get in a full breath.

"No, no. Timmy. Timmy, look at me. Baby Bird, I need you to look at me. Can you do that?"

Tim blinks as the last of the panic finally eases down a little more, and now the anger, the humiliation steps up because he should be the fuck over this shit. It's been almost a year. He should be fine.

Slowly, he raises his head just enough to let his eyes roll up to the two of them, his hands still in his hair, still shaky as hell.

"I… Shit." He sighs through his nose. "I'm sorry, Jay."

Jason finally takes his hand off Dick's shoulder, eyes never wavering from Tim.

"Nothing to be sorry about," and it's a soft burr of his voice, an attempt to be gentle. He comes a little closer, easing himself down on the floor, less than an arm's length away. Dick just sits right beside him, both men in their boxers (when he was pretty sure they weren't when he came through the window).

Realization hits abruptly.

"You came here for me, that's what you two were 'talking' about, right?" Tim finally breaks the silence. "Wow, that's. Fuck. Top five fantasy material there, guys," the joke is weak but no less true. He stares at the carpet, pissed with himself still.

"We thought you were okay enough with us both to make the offer," Dick says in that same way, trying to be super gentle.

A harsh laugh rumbles out of him, "fucked that up brilliantly, didn't I? Shit. A year or so ago, this would have made my fucking life." And his fingers tighten in his hair, sending bursts of pain through his skull (and they got his gauntlets and gloves off at some point. The cape and cowl combo too). "Because it's you two, the first ones I've ever even… and I always thought it was all just this one-sided shit. Figures, goddamned just figure. I can't even..." That harsh, self-deprecating laugh spills out again.

"Timmy," Dick's voice pleading a little and damn him, he looks up without one of his other faces on to hide.

What the two see make them look more concerned when it's his fuck-up, his bad.

"A year ago?" Jason asks softly.

His hands come out of his hair and his heart stutters. "The White Triad needed me to be able to function, to use my hands…they tried other ways to get me to…do what they wanted."

Their eyes blow wide at the revelation and Tim's eyes get stupidly hot. Just fuck.

"I'm sorry," and he swallows, makes his voice stop cracking, "it's too late. I'm damaged goods now and I can't do that to you, to either of you. I-I'm sorry." And he just wants to run, to go back out that window and disappear into the night, to run like he's never run before (and if he thought his legs could hold him, he would already be gone). As is, one hand is on the molding, arm already tightening to pull himself standing.

"You two just go back to sleep, okay? Forget about… Yeah. Forget about this and be happy for my sake. Just do that."

Jay's hand comes into his view, laying over his on the molding, stops him dead. 'Don't touch me. DON'T TOUCH ME. I'm dirty, and you'll never get clean again.'

"Timmy. Take a breath for me, look at me."

But he can't because he's ashamed, so horribly.

"I have to go," he chokes out, forcing his knees to work, forcing his muscles to support his weight as he stands.

Dick is right up with him, blocking him off from the door.

"I don't want to hear that ever again," the elder man says quietly to the top of his head because he realizes Tim can't look him in the eye, "Tim. I'm going to hug you, okay? It's just me. Just Dick."

God, please don't. Please… But Dick's already moving closer, arms coming around him gently and Tim stops breathing.

"Don't," he chokes out, "you can't-" touch me. Fuck.

"If it doesn't hurt you, I can hug you, okay?" Dick is saying in his hair. "Don't run. Don't say anything like that, Tim. They couldn't break you. They couldn't make you anything other than stronger. God, you are so amazing to just keep surviving, to keep fighting no matter what. Tim, I admire you so fucking much and this doesn't change a damn thing about you."

"You don't-" and there's so many things to fill in that statement, isn't there?

Jay's hand eases on the back of his neck, a warm weight, not one that shoves him down, makes him take the abuse.

"I should-" go. Leave you two to yourselves.

"Change into sweats and get some coffee, right? Dick's going to be an epic guy and make you coffee, yeah, Big Wing?"

Dick hums against Tim's hair. "If I can let you go, maybe."

Tim just sighs, and the residual shakes are finally gone. His legs can hold him again so he pulls back from them, eyes over Dick's shoulder because he can't-.

"Thank-you for trusting us," Dick says gently, not fighting to keep Tim in his arms. "Timmy, Baby Bird, thank-you for this."

Tim's face darkens in anger because no, he shouldn't have told them and now they'd see him as perpetually-.

"I never told anyone," and the strained tone just hits a nerve in both Tim and Jason's spines, making them want to fight because Dick never sounds like that.

Dick's eyes are a little glassy, "I didn't trust anyone either, so I get it, okay? I- I'm going to go make you coffee. Sweats and T-shirt, okay?"

## Surprise

*Initially, Dick is the one early on in Fracture to come find Tim in the hidden room at his WE office rather than B.*

He takes a minute to let the pain just wrap around him, to let the nerves twinge. A long breath escapes. He's in the secret room in the back of his office, watching the monitors and getting ready to fix himself up before putting on the suit and going to the meeting. Four members of the board are just sitting in his office around the table, drinking coffee tam provided because of course they were sure the CEO wouldn't mind them waiting. So, that meant Tim Drake would have to be fashionably late to the quarterly meeting once the board was situated in the normal conference room. He wanted to avoid anyone else knowing about the secret room.

None of it was a big deal, in fact it gave him time to check out the nights previous injuries before he had to move on to the next thing. He still half in and half out of uniform, his suit hanging pristine for when the bandages were on and Red Robin was put away for the day. Nothing prepared him for the sound of the elevator opening and Officer Grayson stepping out.

His eyes go wide. The last time he'd seen Dick was the yearly tag up, and later, once he thought about it over and over, replaying every move, every strike, every raz, he realized how out of control it had gotten. How out of control he'd gotten (he'd never use the Demon's Trap on anyone, so why break it out against Dick? Maybe… There was more hurt behind him than he wanted to admit.) So yeah, he felt guilty maybe not that guilty but enough that he probably owed Dick an apology. And here he was, dressed as Officer Grayson to the nines. Shit.

"What-?"

Dick doesn't even stop moving, just wags an eyebrow and snags Tim's wrist to fit a disposable coffee in his palm and puts a white bakers bag in front of him on the counter.

Eyes huge, Tim just stares as Dick grabs the gloves from the top of his first aid kit and pretty much takes a knee right at Tim's side where his under armor is rucked up.

"Whoa!"

Dick snatches his leg to hold him from stepping back, the hand around his calf unyielding. Those eyes are looking up at him with a whole lot of 'let me do this' reflecting at him, and Tim blows a breath through his mouth.

"What are you doing here?" He forces himself to calm.

And he expects some light joke, something along the lines of taking care of the kid or trying to pull the fucking big brother card ("we're both adopted now, Timmy. We legally are brothers." Whatever, Dick.).

What he gets is the guy under the acrobat, the one that's had his share of hard knocks. "Changing it up. I'm doing the right thing for the right reasons, this time."

And Tim has nothing for that.

Just ideas for how the Fracture thing could go

## Understand

And his immediate reaction isn't…positive.

Jay holds up a hand, palm out. "Just wait a second, Baby Bird, before you even start." Now he's ticking off fingers, "no. This ain't the reason why we were trying to get you back. Not for this. Everything we said in the beginning? None of that was to fuck with you."

Dick takes right up with it. "And if you say no right now, we're still going to be here for you. We won't stop being your brothers. You're not going to get rid of us because of this. Whatever way it goes."

"No, this ain't a Robin thing either," Jay interjects, "I mean, this is a Timmy thing. You know, its because you're Tim. That's who we want."

"It's also not just a sex thing," Dick crosses his arms over his chest, "we're not interested in just that."

"We wanna send you to work with coffee and breakfast or with concealer to cover up the marks," Jay smirks. "We wanna call you at the Tower and ask how the fight went and tell you that yer brilliant 'cause you figured it out in time."

"We want you to feel like it's okay to call us and do the same thing," and Dick is smiling gently at him like he's thinking about that happening.

"We wanna ask about your scars, an' have the right to touch 'em, show you how we see you."

"When any of us are in town, we can be together. If it's you and me, me and Jay, you and Jay, or all of us. We want you to be part of our relationship, Tim. Not a one time thing, okay?"

"And not because we think just you need it, but because we…we need it too. We want you. Want you with us, you feel me?"

And it feels like he's watching tennis with all the back and forth. The two older Bats side-by-side like they're meant to be (don't do this, don't shake them up, asshole, they've got a good thing going) and he has this horrible feeling in his chest, just terrible because damn he can take damage and keep walking, keep moving, glue his pieces back together and still stand...but damn if this might really be the thing he can't come back from, no matter how much he wants it, aches for it now that he knows.

And apparently his expression is not in the usual neutral lines because the two share an eye slide.

"Timmy," Jay's voice is a little deeper. "It's okay, right? We kinda thought, uh-" and Jay just trails off a little.

"We thought you were in a good place with us now to let you know how we feel." Dick inserts. "Not that we're trying to pressure you, Tim. We can still be your brothers if that's what you need-"

"-what you want, Baby Bird. If you don't want any part of this mess," Jay does a little hand dance between him and Dick, "we get that. Sometimes it's hard for us too, y'know? But…if it's there for you. It's there for us, too, you know?"

And fuck, how is he going to even-? At this moment, he's absurdly glad for white out lenses.

"I'm-" breathe. Both men are watching him intently with those eyes. "I haven't done a relationship in years, and I don't fuck other vigilantes as a matter of personal preference." Personal code, too many hang-ups. Too much other shit that goes bad. Because seriously, he's learned from his past mistakes. It's too much to be invested in someone that could die in the line of duty just as fast as he could. "It's not…safe." But there's more than that, isn't there?

"If this is a sex thing," it might break me, it might kill me, "I could do it. I could do it for you two. It's… it's always has been the two of you, right from the beginning. That…That didn't change oddly enough. But something more would have negative consequences for you both and I can't do that. Not to you. Either of you." Tim just looks from Jay's unhappy expression to Dick's, but dammit, they'll have to be mad. This is…the right thing. Surely they understand that?

And what comes out of Jay's mouth with those eyes narrowed on him, "then who do you fuck, Tim? People that don't give a shit about you? Don't ask about your scars?"

And faced with that expression, he bites the bullet and tells the fucking truth, "yes. That's who I fuck when I need something more than my hand. People that know a pseud and never see me in the light. People that can't know me. It's-" safe, not painful, not dangerous, "-not ideal, but better than where I was a few years ago."

He shrugs one shoulder, trying to be callous and analytical. This is about a biological need, not about love and acceptance. That shit was a pipe dream, and yeah, it took some hard hits for him to get that.

"You deserve better," Dick admonishes gently, and he also looks upset about this little revelation, but, well, they missed a whole bunch of shit that went down, didn't they? The volume of back story isn't there for them.

The bitter, very unfunny laugh takes him by as much surprise as it does them.

He waves a gloved hand at them, "not going there. Those aren't details either of you need." And he turns his back on them, "I'm getting a shower. Coffee would be righteous, but if you aren't here when I get out, not a problem. Believe me when I say I understand." And he does, doesn't he? A hell of a lot of people walked out on him before, not something new you know.

Back down the hall to his bedroom, wave thrown over one shoulder. When the door closes behind him, he takes a shaky breath, and just gives his brain a few frightening seconds to kick in and evaluate. Unfortunately, his epic planning ability is totally failing him at the moment.

He moves methodically, releasing the security, removing bits of the uniform to hang up in the back hidden space of the closet. His fucking hands are shaking slightly, pissing him off, but he completes the ritual. Boxers when he hits the shower, eyes closed and the dirt of Gotham still on him after a relatively easy patrol.

The hot water rakes down his neck, his back, cutting through the lingering sweat and Kevlar smell while he considers everything.

The bathroom door opens without a knock and he closes his eyes against the water.

"Sorry to spring this on you," Dick says above the sound of water hitting skin. And, dammmit, they should be leaving, not making this harder on him. Just, fuck, even his patience has a limit.

Tim sighs, "I-" did think this would ever happen, couldn't have expected it, get hot at the thought of you two against me like bookends, have wanted you for so long, can't have you. Ever. "It's fine. I didn't expect this is all. I thought you and Jay were good."

"We are," Dick assures in that same gentle tone. "We aren't asking you for this because we're having problems, Timmy." And a soft sound, Dick's voice a little closer over the top of the shower curtain. "We are in a good place, good enough that we're both fine asking you to be with us, now that we understand each other."

"Is this, like, a Robin thing because really Big Wing I'd rather know-"

"Jaybird already answered that."

He sighs to himself because really, he has nothing to offer Dick Grayson and Jason Todd that they don't already have. Nothing.

"Dick-"

"It's hard for you to trust us, I know, Tim." And his voice is a terrible gentle, touching a nerve in that is very Tim Drake, love-struck little kid. "And if this isn't something you're ready for or want at all, then it's okay to tell us that. We…we want you to be honest with us. No lying."

And just, well, because, he means to open his mouth and lie like fuck anyway. Somehow, though, the link from his brain to voice box goes awry. "You're right. I can't trust you with this. It happens again after I've had you two and…I can't trust this, Dick."

Mother. Fucker.

The curtain is pushed back abruptly, jarring him out of 'what the shit did I just say?' To turn bare ass, ready to fight. And Dick is still dressed not giving a single fuck when he gets all Dick about it and pulls Tim into the curve of his body, arms around his bare back and waist and he's fucking naked here and just what now?!

That hand on his scars makes him tighten all over, muscles clench automatically in response. But there's nowhere to run and fighting naked is really Jay's thing anyway.

"Hey, hey. Relax. It's just me, just Dick the hug monster."

"You're in my shower, asshole," but his voice is wrecked and Tim squeezed his eyes shut tight against everything. "Not usually the place for a hug."

A laugh chuffed against the top of his head, and he knows that douche is smiling. "Yeah. Usually the place for more fun stuff if me and Jay can ever convince you that you are so worth the wait."

Dammit, don't say shit like that, his heart can't even take it, man-

"And if we can't, and that's okay too because we really understand why, then it's still the place we'll drag you after a hard patrol to get you cleaned up and your injuries tended. No matter what, no matter the answer, you're not getting rid of us. Not going to happen."

And he sucks in a breath against Dick's shoulder, bare chest hitching against the wet Gotham Knights shirt because he fucking wants to believe. God, he wants. He just WANTS.

And Dick holds him tighter by degrees, one hand in his damn wet hair, lightly scratching his scalp to keep Tim's face pressed against that neck where he smells so good and it's more comforting than it should be, and he's just being fucking pathetic as shit right now, dammit. Dammit.

Tim blinks rapidly to clear out the blurry vision and stop with the bullshit, but Dick turns just enough to press a gentle kiss to his hair and inhale deeply, like he's breathing Tim in…

"It's okay, Timmy, it's okay."

Initial idea for 30

## 30

Jason's eyes are blue.

Fucking blue.

And Tim sucks in a breath like he's dying.

The plan was to use their admittance as a way to distract them long enough to lock the Perch down and get the fuck to the gala, put himself on the line. The White Triad is already looking for him, now he just needs to give them the right opportunity.

His message to them is already prepped. Everything is in place. Everything but this.

Because it's…

Tim just closes his eyes and leans back up, sliding his mouth against Jason Todd's. For the first time in God forever, he allows himself to want.

Jason's hands are tight around his biceps, needlessly holding him still for the onslaught.

And God, this is not what he imagined was going to happen once they got back to the Perch for some detecting. Dick is pressing up against his back, hands coming to grip him at the waist, fingers rubbing circles in his hip bones, making him weak with it.

And if his hands come up, one to get stuck in Jason's hair, one to reach back and grip at Dick's thigh, well, that's just another part of the plan coming together.

(But God, it's so, so good…)

\*\*

He takes them to the bedroom. To be more correct, they take him, Dick unabashedly lifting him up by the thighs, his chest pressing against the Nightwing symbol, finger stripes holding his back since his legs are wrapped around Dick's waist, holding himself up.

And Jason has no problem following, shedding the Red Hood as they make their way through the perch, his cape taking a hike along with the harness and utility belt somewhere along the way.

The tunic comes off while Jason pulls his head back to take his mouth again, groaning when the zipper of the undersuit gives the older Bats something to do with their hands.

When they get to bare skin, he makes choked noises of shock and need without realizing it. God, it had been so long, too long since he'd been touched like this.

And being held up between them is like something from his overactive imagination. Something unattainable until now. When Jason's callouses move over a scar in his chest, his hips jolt. When Dick mouths at this collar bone, his back arches, offering himself up instinctively.

"That's right, Timmy," has been Jason's dark demand, "gimmie it. All a' it." And that mouth sucked at his chest, making him keen louder while Dick sucked him down deep.

He was already over sensitive at their thorough investigations, almost ready to die before ever getting to the main event.

"S-slow down," he gasps, "c'mere and lemme-"

"Nope," Jason interjects while Dick takes him deeper, making his hips twitch against those hands, and makes a negative noise around his throbbing cock.

His fists clench tighter in the sheets.

"That's what I wanna see," Jason purrs, low and deep against him, making a shudder pass through his bones. "Baby Bird feelin' good, yeah? Lookit how pink you are, how hard in Dickie's mouth?"

He manages to get a hand free

\*\*

And he looks down on the two of them fondly, his chest aching with how right they look in his bed, in his space, in his LIFE. It's an amalgamation of everything he's ever wanted.

And that conversation he has with the Bats after they pulled him out of the Metakiller debacle comes back with clarity.

They'd thought he was a suicidal vigilante in the time before they started shoving themselves into his life again. Just because he always had a plan in case he didn't come back-

But at the time, they weren't in the right place to get it. The reality behind the sitch.

He made Plans to protect the people he cared about, the people he loved. He tried thinking of everything so they would be protected-

Just like he's doing right now with Dick and Jason.

\*\*

When they wake, the message starts to play:

\-Tim gives them a low down of what is going to happen. He holds up a bat tracer and puts it on while they watch with a "come get me." Kind of thing.
