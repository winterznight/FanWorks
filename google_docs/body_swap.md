My lovely @jayseedub wanted a continuation of the Body Swap thing found here. Ah, it’s very angsty because I just--I wanted a knock-down-drag-out fight between these two. I want Dick just as pissed as Tim (because of than “you’re my big brother Dick, I know you’ll always come for me,” line Tim fed him in the Red Robin comic. Such a load of crap, right?). I wanted Tim *screaming*, and welp, I got it. (So prepare for the feel train, it’s rolling down the track).

Ah, and a new HC that really makes me feel better about the whole Dick taking the tunic thing, but you can read about it and let me know what you think ;)

A few days after the little *incident*, he’s settled back into his usual routine: check with his team, track any nefarious activity, do any necessary tech refreshes, and dip out to track any number of leads.

He’s on the *dip out* part, already suiting up and packing some supplies for an extensive trip out to start up with infiltrating an underground fighting ring he thinks might be a cover for something a *hell* of a lot worse when the Tower’s systems tell him someone with a passcode not Titan specific has touched-down on the roof.

The systems pops up a screen so he can watch the Javelin ease down, effectively blocking his own plane from being able to take off.

Behind the whiteouts, his eyes narrow, but he’s moving to the communal floor, giving the executive override to the elevator sliding slowly to his Perch. The re-direct is going to be better for however *this* little convo is going to go.

He double-checks his utility belt absently as the doors slide open.

“Titans are out,” he starts, “you’ll have to pull the JL roster instead.”

Nightwing stops *dead* at the lack of humor or empathy. It’s just business as fucking usual--*natch*. And Big Wing pauses with it, calculating the last time before the body swap incident that he’d actually seen the face, the *eyes*, under the mask before he was staring at it in the mirror. (*Why didn’t he realize it before?*)

Soft click and a whirl when central air kicks in, blowing cold on his neck and shoulders, but he doesn’t flinch, doesn’t *move*. From behind the whiteouts, he’s staring, eyes moving over Red’s abdomen, seeing the roadmap of scars, seeing the new scores against the good guys, seeing a whole lot of *vigilante* without any of the *kid* he used to see.

That’s the only good thing about the swap now, isn’t it?

It was impossible for Tim to duck and hide if he wasn’t even in his own *body*.

“I really *hate* the sewers under the east side, Timmy,” he comes back easily, forcing it to be Tim and Dick, not N and Red. He doesn’t feel any kind of bad, “But you *knew* that. You’ve known that since your were in the Robin tunic, so that was a nice way to get back at me.” Now he’s moving forward, eyes for every twitch, every breath, every aborted attempt at a pocket in the utility belt, the slight twitch of the head to indicate the eyes moving for some other escape.

But, that isn’t going to happen.

Because now he *sees* how things have progressed. He can pick out the shadows and old pain in the slight scar on Tim’s cheekbone and the familiar furrow of his forehead--one he’d always associated with the baddies, Tim’s *planning to break shit* furrow (and well, who’s getting a load of that *now*?)

Even if Tim’s playing leader of the Titans, playing at keeping himself above the petty fucking emotions that leave him open and vulnerable, Dick, for the first time in *too long* sees right past the facade.

And his lip curls up in a sneer, slow boiling anger that’s been simmering for *days*, one that started the moment he let himself out of Tim’s Perch in a body that was *fucked* with new scars and lack of crucial viscera. Once he realized Tim had been lying to him the whole time--had just been playing some sort of fucked-up *role--* the slow, churning betrayal turned into anger just *that quick.*

Tim had let himself step back and away, hadn’t *trusted* him enough to open his damn mouth with the Real. Fucking. Deets.

(*Why did you stop ****talking**** to me?! Why didn’t you tell me it was all too much? Why did you let yourself slip through my grip? Dammit, Tim. God*dammit.)

And. It. *Hurts*. Hurt to know Tim pulled the deflection card on him. On. *Him*. (The guy that apparently lies to whoever the hell Batman *is* at the time).The devices they used against criminals and murderers, against megalomaniacs and psychopaths, the weapons they used to hide the meaty humanity under the capes so the baddies couldn’t *break* them open with it--

Their tools to stop the bad guys.

And Tim used it on *him*.

So when Nightwing resumes his stalk, to come face-to-face with his little bro-- the leader of the Titans (and just how *fucked* is it that he’s pretty sure Tim doesn’t want to be called that now, well too damn *bad*), his hips roll in a smooth, seamless motion anyone that *knew him* knew meant *time to get ****real***. Just like he suspects, like he half-hoped *wouldn’t* happen, Tim’s fingers flicker, probably activating the gauntlets to spit something out in his palm (he’s already re-programmed himself to be on the offensive, not to fight *with* but to fight *against*).

“I think having Hood write all over my fucking back kind of makes us even,” Red Robin comes back, neutral and empty. “Besides, Croc was still in Arkham. You’re welcome.” The *asshole* doesn’t necessarily have to be said to be understood.

“Even?” And it’s low, dangerous. Nightwing’s movements are precise and even as he raises the whiteouts so those electric blue eyes can hyperfocus, to give complete *attention*. “You think we’re *even,* Tim?” And Dick leans down just enough to put the two of them close, “because I sure as *hell* don’t think so.”

And the furrow in that forehead gets deeper, sharper, almost the *time to fight* furrow. “I served my fucking *time* as Robin, I did what I set out to do, and your protege gets what he wants. It’s fine, right? The day gets saved. So what the hell is *your* problem?”

Oh no. Oh no he *didn’t*.

Dick’s upper lips curls in a sneer, “did what you set out to do? Is *that* how it went? You never *wanted* to be part of the family in the first place? You just wanted to get being Robin done and *over with* because it just some *obligation*?”

The furrow falls away from Red’s brow because *what now?*

“Your mom and dad were always away, so training, fighting, taking up *my name* was what to you? Something to keep you *busy*? Were we just a damn *hobby *or something, Tim? Is *that* what you’re trying to tell me?” The warm edge is bleeding through, but finally, he seems to get *somewhere*.

Because Tim draws back insanely *fast* and gives absolutely *no shits* about punching him right in the face.

“**Fuck.*** ****You****!” *And it’s Tim that’s yelling back at him, it’s *Tim*. Not Red, not the mask, not the cold shoulder.

Dick doesn’t fight it, doesn’t counter it, doesn’t come back even though he’s fairly pissed right the hell off, but he works his jaw a little (because that? Was a nice one) and straightens up to the clenched fists and bared teeth.

“You could have *said *that a long time ago,” Dick comes back because, *no Tim*, we’re not just letting it *go*, “that we were only some way to pass the time, not that you ever wanted *us, *just the *fucking* name. All you wanted was the R all that time? Would have been nice if you’d just *said* so, then I wouldn’t have gotten so *invested* in you--”

And he’s calculating, wondering how much more Tim can take before he breaks, before he finally spills out his weakness (reads as: *the truth*).

“I-I fucking *bled* for that cape, *you asshole*. I almost *died* time and fucking *time* again *for that cape*. My *dad*, my fucking *dad, Dick,*” and the hitch is still there, the utter *agony*, “...all-all because I was Robin. I kept Bruce on the straight and narrow as much as he *let me*. And what the *fuck* did it all mean?! What the *fuck* did it *get me?!* Thrown out on my ass? Told I was crazy? That I just had to *accept it* when Bruce was “dead?” How many superheroes get another chance? Like Jason-*Mother*\-*Fucking*\-Todd?! How farfetched is it *really*?”

And Dick lets him spit it out, the warming anger burning away the icy calm of Red (*reads as the ****other**** Robin*) to reveal slivers of Tim Drake--the teenager in *pain*.

*That’s* the face he wants to see again, his partner and friend, *Timmy*. Because Dick gets the *vigilante* now, after mapping the journey from losing the cape until now, tracking the baddies, tracking the trail to find Batman, seeing what kind of things *“Robin couldn’t do,*” all of it justified *who* and *what* Red Robin is. But Tim? The young, damaged kid under the mask is the one Dick needs to *help*, needs to see, needs to *understand*. And, no, he isn’t leaving until they hash this out. So, tough, Timmy. *I’ve got you now*.

“You couldn’t even look me *in the face*,” is almost screamed at him, Tim refusing to back the hell down, his hands shaking with the poison pouring out, all the mistakes and misunderstandings, all the strain and stress, the hard decisions and unavoidable repercussions. He fully intends to give back in *spades*. “You threw some *bullshit* about being equals and gave another kid *my name*. It wasn’t *yours then*. I made it *mine*. It’s all I had *left*, the only thing I had left of *Bruce*, and you gave it the fuck away like I meant *nothing*. Like I was *garbage*. *I* *had nothing else left.*”

But Dick moves, gripping his biceps in an unforgiving hold and already ducking a hand under Tim’s defenses to rip off the domino, to look at *him*, not the whiteouts.

Snarling and ferocious, wet eyes and *bared teeth*, seeing what happened, what those tough choices did to him, to *them* makes Dick’s jaw clench down and his chest fucking *ache*.

“You *idiot*. You had *me*. Dammit, Tim, you’ve *always had me*. I thought you knew that. I thought after everything, *everything* we’d been through, in the five years we bled* together*, you’d always *know* I’m here for you. I’m here for you **no matter what**. No matter what happens, or how far you *go,* you *always* have *me*.”

The younger vigilante in his hold, the one fighting against his grip like a bleeding, dying animal is snarling and growling in such fucking *pain* (and he’d missed it, missed how much he hurt Tim, how much damage they’ve done to one another without really *trying*).

He grips harder, not letting Tim pull away this time, not letting him hide behind Red.

“Robin is just a fake *name*, Tim. Dammit, Robin isn’t, was *never,* *who you are*. Didn’t you figure that *out* in the damn *desert?*” And he bares his teeth as well, shaking the younger vigilante just so he doesn’t give him *nuclear noogies* and *months of endless cuddles*. Just *how could Tim be *such* a dumb ass not to have ****known****?* Not to have *called*? Not to have just said *something*?

Was the trust between them broken *that badly?* Why the hell had Dick even *believed him* when he said he *knew* Dick would always catch him? Why hadn’t he seen through the bullshit back *then?*

Tim’s nose is turning red, his watery eyes narrowed, every muscle tensed up for the *fight or flight* instinct to kick in. Dick doesn’t give him the chance. Even if he is still *supremely pissed*, he pulls Tim hard into his chest, wraps both arms around him *tight*, trapping him at the waist and shoulders, a hand on his neck, waiting for the right time to slide into his hair. It’s how Tim used to need it after a hard night, a bad *run* of it, and Dick is shameless in using it to his every advantage. He puts his cheek down on the top the crown of too-long hair and breathes against Tim’s ear, “You have it *wrong*. I didn’t think you were *crazy*. You weren’t talking to anyone long before Bruce disappeared. You were pulling back, pulling away, and *I couldn’t help you*. You wouldn’t let me *help you*, Timmy. You had a *gun*, and I know you had it in your hand the night I happened to call and check on you. I always *knew*.”

And the body he can’t let *go* of is shuddering harder in his arms at the reveal, that Dick had always *known* what the third Robin was ready to do, how far gone he had almost *been*. If Dick Grayson hadn’t called him that night, forced him to keep talking, pretty much kicked the door in to the shitty apartment in the ‘Haven with the phone still up to his ear. If Dick had just *hung up the phone*.

Well, they wouldn’t be *here* now, would they?

“I didn’t know what else to *do*. *Dammit*, being Robin was *killing* you and you couldn’t even see it.”

Frozen for long moments, Tim blinks rapidly against his watery vision at the plain cream wall over Dick’s shoulder because well, *that* changes things just a little, doesn’t it?

*(Was it? Was the tunic really killing him back then? He made bad calls after Dad, after everyone-- but-but...*the .45 auto was the most solid thing he’d held for a while*)*.

“Dr. Erin O’Malley is a therapist known in *our circles*. How do you think Roy kicked the habit? And who Ollie saw when he came back from his soul-searching thing? Barry told her about his *mom*, for heaven’s sake, Timmy! She knows J’onn isn’t from around here, and Kara has *big brother* issues with Clark. After Blockbuster and-and Tarantula, she helped *me* too. Hell, the majority of her clientele are *superheroes*, and that’s why I called her. I was getting desperate for you to talk to someone, *anyone* before you did *something*.” And the fear might be old and dusty, but Dick’s tone gets thin with it anyway, the ‘he’s going to kill himself’ vibe crawling down his spine, that made him chase after Tim right after he left the Cave, ready to leave Gotham behind to go on his quest to find Bruce.

He feels Tim’s chest stutter against his, feels how hard Tim is biting down on his lower lip to keep the half-sob *in*. The harness is digging into the thin Kevlar lining of the Nightwing suit, and he makes an irritated noise, pulling one arm away *just long enough* to deactivate the thing and toss it on one of the couches without really letting Tim escape.

“The not telling you about Dami taking up the mantle was wrong, and I am such an *asshole* for it. I’m sorry, Tim. I’m so *sorry*.”

He feels the tremble go through Tim’s whole body at the admission. He *feels* how the younger vigilante tries to ruthlessly *squash* what he believes is an obvious weakness by trying to pull back again, shoving his palms against Dick’s chest to get leverage. Dick just sweeps his arms by his sides and wraps himself around Tim like a blanket, walking them backwards a few feet to press Tim against the wall so he’s less likely to escape.

“I am sorry how it all happened, but I don’t regret making you move on. Someone had to break you out of the spiral before it killed you, and as much as it sucks and I *hated it*, it still *worked*. The stuff with Ra’s? We are eventually going to *talk about* because *you*, you should have called me *dammit*. How *fast *do you think I would have torn the Cradle *apart* looking for you? Faster than Clark when Lois is in some kind of *peril*. Honestly, when have I ever *left you* when you called? *Especially when you magically ****lose**** a spleen*?!”

And all the facts, all the digging, all the new information makes him clench his jaw with how much he didn’t even *know*, the muscle jumping against Tim’s temple and his arms unconsciously tighten even *more*, absorbing the progressive tremble of limbs and chest, of forced, slow breathing, and the attempt to keep *control*.

“I’m so *pissed off* right now, Tim. So. Pissed, but I’m not letting you *go*. Hell. No. Not this time, *do you understand me?*”

“Go to *hell*,” but the tone is thick and wet, the struggle renews with vigour, “like you have any reason to be *pissed?* You had no problem when that little *asshole* made sure I knew I was just a fucking *stand-in*.”

“Dami was an asshole to *everyone*\--” he starts to placate, but pauses when he remembers the acidic tone, the *honesty* in Dami’s tone when he was the one wearing Tim’s face.

Maybe he’d underestimated how much Dami had an impact back then--

Obviously he *has* since Tim find the weakness in his hold, grips his wrist, turns on his heel *fast*, and *throws* him in a familiar move.

But since Dick *was* Robin, *was* Batman, *is* Nightwing, he rebounds off the wall and comes back for it, missing Tim by a miniscule margin when the younger folds his knees at just the right second.

Dick lands it on the Communal Floor’s kitchen, landing crouched on top the island without even a wobble, and stares Tim down with a frown marring his features.

“I didn’t *know* it was that bad, Tim. I *didn’t know*\--”

“Of course you didn’t,” with scathing heat behind it. “It’s not like you’d want to hear *anything* against *your fucking Robin* now would you?” And all that tightly wound anger, all that pent-up *pain* is so obvious in the way Tim refuses to advance, refuses to let his voice raise again.

“Tim, I swear, at the time--”

“But you *got* what you *wanted*, didn’t you, Dick?” Is all dangerous now, low and pitched, the flash of Tim’s teeth in the overhead lights, “you got the Robin you *wanted*, the Robin that was fucking *blood*. It wouldn’t have *mattered* if you’d paid enough to attention to know he *cut my fucking zip line*, or *he’s *the one that took me *out* of the Cave’s mainframe like I was a *stain* on the tunic. Even if you *knew* all of that at the time, *what would it have really mattered?* I was just the *stand-in* from the first time you wore the cowl, and I *get it* now.”

“***No****,*” Dick snarls, leaping off the island in a smooth flow of muscle and power, countering Tim’s duck and dodge, forcing the leader of the Titans back against the wall again, “*that isn’t true*. That was *never* true,” and his voice has gone deep, dark, eyes narrowed outlined by the domino, “you were *always* my partner, just as much as Bruce was, *so were you*.”

“Don’t fucking *lie* to me now--” Tim comes back, his voice half-hoarse from yelling, screaming, his whole body clenched *tight*, “if I would have know that *truth*, it would have been *easier* from the start. Bruce didn’t *hide it from me*, Dick. You did!”

And *that* little bomb drop? Oh Bruce is going to *hear about this*.

Later when there would be audio and vid. Then the Batman could have his own time to address this obviously gross *oversight*.

For now, though, he’s going to make a *hell* of a lot of things very *clear*.

“In the beginning, I didn’t *want* a twelve-year old getting involved. You’re right about that. I didn’t *want* you to take up the tunic and neither did Bruce, so you are *one hundred percent right*. In the *beginning*, Tim, we *didn’t* want you.”

And just the facial ticks, the tightening of a gloved fist, the tells Tim had apparently tried so hard to train *out* of himself since he’d been Red, give Dick so much *more* than he had before-- realizing how *long* this had been something at the back of Tim’s brain pan.

“It would be too easy for your to get hurt, for you to *die*. You had a *dad* who would *mourn you*, Tim. You still had *family*. You still had things to lose Bruce and Jason and I *never did*, so *no*, we didn’t want you risking your life for *our* Mission.”

Clenching jaw, eyes getting wet again, but Dick watches Tim flutter his eyes to hold *back*. Not there yet, *not there yet*.

“But in the first *year*, you proved how smart and capable you are. You didn’t back down, you didn’t *give in* or give *up*. You wore that tunic like it was the only thing that *mattered*. You gave the role of Robin more than I did at that age or Jason did. You made Robin a force to be reckoned with, and you made us, me and Bruce, so fucking *proud*. So *proud* you stood by us and just *kept on fighting*. You *became* our family, Tim, my brother and Bruce’s *son*. Blood didn’t matter, it *never mattered*. Not then and not now. Despite *all of it*, you’re still and always *going to be* my little brother and nothing, *nothing* is going to change that.” A little fact he is going to *pound* into Dami’s skull because some little birds need to *realize*, the *first* Robin was never blood either. The ‘true son’ is going to get one *hell* of a lesson when he gets back to Gotham.

But for right now, *for right now*, Tim’s eyes are wet and blown wide in surprise, his hands and arms half-poised, frozen in shock but for the small, almost imperceptible trembling (*Oh, God, Tim, how long have you felt like this? How long have you believed--?*). When Tim drags in a breath, lets out a broken, choked, noise, Dick is right up in his space, gripping and holding hard by the time his eyes spill over.

It a horrible and wonderful thing at the same time, when Tim’s shaky hands come up under his arms, around his back, and *grips* his shoulders tight enough that the bruises are going to be *epic*. When Tim’s face is hidden in the side of his neck, and he can feel the tears sliding down his skin to the suit, knows the younger vigilante is still trying to fight *it* instead of just letting *go*.

Dick turns his face enough to bury his nose in the too-long hair and close his own hot eyes *tight* because he *missed this*. Missed this too much to bear.

His tone is gruff and wobbly, his hold inescapable when he finally comes out with it, “we… We may not have wanted you in the beginning, Tim but we sure as hell did in no time *at all*. Geeze, you’re an idiot. I mean, who *wouldn’t* want *you?* Even immortal megalomaniacs want a piece of *that*.”

Half-laughing and half-sobbing, Tim’s muscles try to contract, try to make himself *smaller* in such a familiar move that Dick blinks fast but still manages to get a few wet drips in Tim’s hair. He gives absolutely *zero* shits about it and manages to reach down and get an arm under Tim’s knees to lift him up high against Dick’s chest, takes them both to one of the couches on the communal floor where he can sit with Tim in his lap and hold on for as long as he can.
