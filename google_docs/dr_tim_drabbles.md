## Dr!Tim: Bad Night

Jay is the one that catches him, and Tim completely *freezes* for about ten seconds.

“Tim*my*,” is a low growl, drawn out in displeasure as the Red Hood comes in from patrol and sees his injured boyfriend at the kitchen table working with a fresh cup of coffee rather than on the couch *where they left him*.

They gave Speedy and Specs *one job*. One. Fucking. Job.

“Hi, Honey,” the doctor chirps back after a second, “how was your night stomping the shit out of bad guys?”

The usual air of *bad ass* surrounding Jason Todd follows when he hits the lock on the helmet, and casually scoots the laptop out of the way. He’s shameless in slanting his mouth over Tim’s, giving his usual *hi Sweet, howareya?* until he smirks like a nasty bastard at the pink on those cheeks, straightens up to get his gloves and gauntlets off, and then raid the coffee pot on the counter.

“S’all right. No escapes from Arkham. Blackgate’s pretty quiet. Couple ‘a runners had some inside tips. Might be legit, but we’ll check ‘em out.”

Tim hums, slides out of his seat before Jason turns back around and easily opens the oven door. His first attempt at dinner (by an easy recipe provided by one Mr. Alfred Pennyworth) is still nice and warm, waiting for his significant others to get done with their night.

(He’s very, *very* lucky it was pretty much, cut up this, this, and this. Put in these pre-sealed seasonings and some butter, Master Timothy. Master Jason and Master Dick will be overjoyed.)

So he gets the ironically bat-shaped oven mitts and pulls the covered casserole dish out to set it on top the counter and ease the lid off.

Jason’s eyes are *huge* when he comes poking his nose over Tim’s shoulder, already drawn in by the *smell*.

“Oh? Whatja make there, Timmers? Mmm. Smells good.”

“I hope it tastes good, too,” he stirs the concoction, pokes a potato, blows on it before he gives it a shot. Hm, not bad. Maybe Mr. Pennyworth has all the right answers after all.

Jay makes a noise over his shoulder, and Tim spears another potato, blows on it before holding it to the Red Hood’s mouth.

Those eyes blink once before Jay leans in and takes the bite, his eyes a softer shade of blue than usual. His coffee cup foregone on the counter so both hands can wrap around Tim’s hips, and he can press another kiss on his smaller boyfriend’s mouth without knocking them both over.

“You taste better, but still’s good, yeah?”

And because he’s just...*gone* for these idiots, he grins back, starts to limp over to the cabinet to get a plate, but gets turned by those hands instead. Jason lifts him effortlessly to plunk his butt down on the countertop and lay another one on him.

Tim manages to get his hands inside the jacket so he can feel the smoothly moving muscle over shoulders down the broad back, lets Jay nuzzle against his nose without getting completely pink.

When he looks up, the window is already sliding closed silently, and his other boyfriend looks none the worse for wear after a hard night with Robin while B is away with the Justice League.

And even though he can’t see past the whiteouts, he can already tell someone has not had a good night.

The little *tells* are there, the way his muscles draw up tight, making the suit seem to outline them, cracks in Dick’s proverbial armor. He wouldn’t even take off the gloves or domino, wouldn’t let himself get too *close*, just wave and take off to the shower first, closing the door softly but resoundingly *firm*.

Tim’s hand tightens around Jay’s bicep as the two watch him take the time he *needs*.

“Oh,” Tim’s voice is small, his eyes softening.

“S’all right Timmy,” Jay says against his hair. “Bad night for those two, s’all.”

The Red Hood does move an arm to wrap around his waist, pull him closer to the counter for Tim to lay his forehead against the red bat symbol splashed across his chest. The two stay there, comforting one another until the sound of the shower running infiltrates the moment.

“Go on and eat,” Tim finally hops down, gives Jay a push toward the steamy goodness waiting for them. “I slaved over a hot stove for you two.”

With one more stolen kiss, Jay picks up his coffee and agreeably doles out the thrown together meal, humming appreciatively. His eyes flicker over the laptop screen before he takes a seat, getting an eyeful of objective text breaking down the usual kind of chemical warfare they face on the street.

(It’s Timmy tryin’ ta gedda jump on the baddies, tryin’ ta keep them *safe* as he can manage--it’s enough effort to make the hardened vigilante hide a grin as he takes his seat at the table.)

Once he starts eating the cooked vegetables, potatoes, and chicken, he realizes how *good* it really is, and listens to his civilian boyfriend talk about the files B sent and the analysis he ran on Wally’s sample. While they still don’t know much about the Speed Force and how it does what it *does*, Tim can at least tell them what happens to the Flash when his new powers start to manifest (*“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Tim is saying, starting down at the shiny surface of the table, “when he was struck by lightening, it did something to his cell maturation process. He can produce the initial burst of turbo speed because his cell life is cut in half, so the excess energy expends all at once. There’s no explanation for how it *doesn’t* kill him.” “‘S’why they gotch ya on it, Timmers. If anyone can figure it out, it’s you.” “Well...maybe?”*)

And Jay feels just the right kind of full and warm, lets Tim take his plate to the sink and wash it while he smokes his post-dinner cigarette at the table with his head back and his eyes closed, listening to the cadence of Tim’s voice while the shower runs longer than necessary.

He’s done and about to

*The stress is real, so I’m taking a darn break before I start on the big things. *

\*\*

Nightwing is half-suited up while his laptop runs analysis on the desk in his hotel room. He’s stocking up, palming pellets and hiding contingencies, while the data from his current case in Gotham calculates. Once the results come back, he’s going to forward them to the Cave and let B take it from there.

It’s been exactly *one week* since he had to step between Batman and Robin and the usual amount of *bickering*. (Those two? Too much alike. Bruce is, however, *very* fortunate there had been *time* to get Dami a little less...*abrasive* in the year the OG Batman had been lost in time). The promise he’d made to stay put in Gotham (instead of chase after a certain consistently MIA little brother) completely fulfilled now that he’s sure B and Rob weren’t going to *kill* each other— which leaves him free to take care of unfinished business.

The Red Hood has been moving steadily closer to the family, even staying at the Manor *an entire day* in which Alfred enlisted his help for dusting the top most shelves of pretty much *everywhere*. (He has no idea how many hidden classics had been dug out during the clean-a-thon, but he’s pretty sure it had been the reason Hood is staying a little more *in touch* nowadays.) Batgirl is rocking out the name with her usual kick-ass attitude. Since taking on the mantle when Cass went more for the cat-eye mask variety, she’s let herself be reeled in a little closer, too. In the absence of her favorite former Robin, she’d been the second step in integrating Robin into the role and out of *bad habits*. In a few months, their brand of snark is completely all for show as is proven any time the new Robin miscalculates a *smidge* (Little D is still *learning,* Steph, do you *really* want me to remind you of that *time*—).

All-in-all, his siblings and mentor are closer to home, and it was *nice* to have an occasionally full roster in one of the most dangerous cities in the US.

Except *one*.

And N is in Moscow in his thermal suit (because it is goddamned *cold* in Russia this time of year, *Timmy*) to finally get on the tracks of the rare and elusive Red Robin.

\*\*

*My soulmate deserves all the love, so a bit more little Timmy with the Bats*

The house is always *quiet*. Even when his mom and dad were home or Mrs. Mac was in the kitchen when he got home from school, the upstairs is always silent, like the museums where his parents sell what they find on digs. He thinks it’s always been like that.

No one ever goes to the upstairs attic, though. The dust is thick and settled, it’s own niche in Drake Manor. There’s one window to look out the back yard and off into the sea (and if you looked really, *really* hard, you could almost see Wayne Manor up on the bluffs, a dark silhouette in the dawn). The nights he didn’t go out into Gotham with his camera, he usually wound up here, squeezed into the non-existant seat to watch for the headlights of the large, black car that was unmistakable even in full dark.

And tonight, a few days after Robin saved him from a bad fall, and the extraordinary turn of events that put him in their direct path rather than an outsider that just *knew* their secret, he’s still *waiting*. At the time, he grudgingly turned over the box of photographs when Robin (*Jason*) and Nightwing (*Dick)* brought him home. They were working a hard case and would be gone for a few days, so he did what he was expected to do, had promised to go to school and stay out of trouble.

He hasn’t gone out into Gotham, and hasn’t heard or bothered them since. It’s not a problem for him, really. He’s *used* to these kinds of things. Promises from grownups that never come to fruition. Coming home for his birthday. Taking him with them during Christmas break. Being there for the Science Fair.

Sometimes expectations fail. Sometimes you need another plan. Sometimes other things have to take precedent. All the real world *truths*.

So, it’s *really* okay. He gets it.

The vigilantes didn’t expect a *kid* to figure them out, not when they’ve got the whole world fooled. It makes sense they would want to give him something to look *forward* to, a “reward” for keeping quiet about their secret identities. (And it isn’t like he doesn’t *realize* how dangerous it is to *know*, how many of Batman’s enemies would come looking for him just to get the secret, how dangerous *he* is to them now just because he was too smart for his own good. He’s...he’s a *liability*.)

By the second night with no word, he’s convinced himself the whole thing is going to amount to checking in on him quarterly to make sure he keeps out of trouble, doesn’t call any attention to himself or them. It’s the *adult* thing to do. So, he’s going to give it a few weeks, wait until they’ve all but forgotten, and go back to his old haunts. He’ll have to be more careful they don’t catch him, that he doesn’t slip up and accidentally almost kill himself again.

It’ll be fine. He’s got darker clothes to stay closer to the shadows and has been tinkering around with a shooting grapple gun like Robin used. He thinks he might have figured it out, but *testing* is really going to be the problem.

And...and it *is* fine (it’s disappointing but inevitable). They didn’t need some *kid* hanging around when they had criminals to stop and a city to save.

He’s sleepily convinced himself it was all for the best, his *one chance* to live the life, but the reality is nothing but trouble could come from stepping into their world. He could get hurt or *die*, he could get *them* hurt if he got caught and they had to come save him. Or they’d get tired of dealing with him eventually, his endless questions and terrible hand/eye coordination, his fanboy *awe* and clumsy stumbles, the odd moments when he can fit in the most awkward spaces to hide (*like right now*).

Eventually...it be the same as with his mom and dad. They’d just *leave*.

Tim sighs and forces himself to be *reasonable* because of course it’s *better this way*. Nothing would change (it’s okay, it could be *worse*). Besides, it was better than *never coming back*.

When the rumbling goes by the house, goes further, deeper into the woods, toward the only other home, he can let his eyes slide closed, glad they made it back from another night, and let himself drift off a little. No school tomorrow, no Mrs. Mac, no reason to get up early and make an appearance.

He’d probably read more on the coding manual he’d picked up from the library, ride his bike into the city for pizza and to hang out with Ives, then come back home before his *curfew*. He would wait it out a few weeks and then jump back to old habits, keeping out of their way, and staying in the shadows. Life would just—

*Go* *on*.

The world gets fuzzy and soft and dark, and even with the minor ache in his neck and back from the odd angle, even in the quiet upstairs, even though he *knows* it’s too cold to be sleeping up here, the dream starts out anyway..

“—glad we found him, Big Wing.” That’s...that’s *Jason*, isn’t it? (Jason *here*? ...nah)

“I wonder how long he’s been up here all alone?”

(It has to be a dream because they came looking for him…)

“Musta been a while. He’s freezin’.” The dream hand is warm on his forehead, so *nice*, not enough to make him want to come to reality, so he just snuffles against his arm and hums, not trying to swim to the surface of awake, not yet.

“Okay, okay. Not leaving Timmy by himself at night anymore. Check.” Dick sighs, his breath a puff in the cold, and cranes his neck to eye the configuration the kid squeezed through to get to the wide window ledge.

“B’s gonna talk ta his folks when they make it back ta town anyhow.” And Jason shakes his head, burrowing a little deeper in his jacket with bare face (doms keep the eyes warm, you feel him?). “Kid his age shouldn’t be left alone anyhow.”

“Nope, just circus brats and street kids, right Little Wing?” Dick glances over at his replacement with a wide grin (and if B is serious about keeping Timmy now that the business with Two-Face is over, he’s going to have to come around more to help corral *two* younger brothers).

“Yeah, some a’ us can take care of *business*, Dick. This kid? He don’t need ta be in a house alone like this. Ain’t right.” The current Robin just frowns at the small silhouette, eyebrows drawing together.

“Alfred has his room ready, so at least he’ll have somewhere *warm* with a window. How did he even get *in* there?” And Dick? Is an *acrobat* and this configuration is making him flinch.

But Jay just smirks back, “Wiry little shit, apparently. Already fittin’ in.”

“Apparently. Let’s get him out of there, shall we *Robin*?”

And he huffs drowsily, swimming in and out of consciousness, the lack of sleep in the last few days making him sink further down where the voices are muffled, muted.

He might make some grunting sound when dream hands lift his heavy limbs, weightlessness like this a foreign concept, but it’s not like dreams where you step down abruptly and jar awake. It’s warm and smells like leather, Kevlar, and musk. And his brain gives him what he wants in the dream, soft cotton to fist his hands into without having to do anything more than sigh.

“Poor little guy is tuckered out. We shouldn’t have left him so long. It doesn’t look like he’s been sleeping.”

The transition is down, *steps*, his blurry mind supplies.

“He chases us through Gotham, yeah? Sleep probably ain’t even in his vocabulary.”

“He’s so *small*, Little Wing. He needs to sleep.”

“He needs goddamned *parents, *Dickie.”

“...it’s okay,” is breathed against his hair, “he has us now.”

“Sure, sure. Lotta grown ass men what dress up in tights n’ masks. Normal as they come.”

“Hey! It’s not a bad life, you know. I turned out just fine, thank-you very much.”

A grunt in reply and something warm tucked around him before the air shifts and it’s cold, making his small body tighten again, start to swim a little closer to consciousness. But he’s snuggled higher, closer to strength and warmth.

(*All the good things*)

“Ah. I see you two have managed to ferret out the missing Master then?”

“Shoulda seen ‘im, Alf. Alla way up in the attic window.”

“You have a similar *propensity* for small spaces, Master Jason. Master Dick as well if memory serves. Very *high*, small spaces to be precise.”

“Not my fault there’s so *many* in the Manor, Alfred. Those are the perfect places to explore.”

“Hm,” the car doors close as Alfred Pennyworth shuts his young charges in (*three* now, not including *you*, Master Bruce. He is not getting any *younger*, you understand?) and moves to the driver’s side through the chill.

Master Jason and Master Dick continue a quiet conversation while the child sleeps on and the dark forests pass them by. Alfred inputs when necessary with the usual *plans* on the next few nights of patrol ahead of them sans the Batman, and it does the butler’s heart good to see them finally getting along. Just as he told the worrywart that *is* his eldest charge, the two needed time to find their own way. Time and exposure, more appropriately.

As Alfred is well aware, the life his family leads, one of the night, one of pain and bruises and burns, one of trauma after trauma with only the strength of *will* and people in need to drive them, it required a certain amount of humanity to maintain. The strength of their bonds, to lean on one another in times of need, had been the hardest lesson for Master Bruce to learn as the Batman,, and one he would daresay he failed to pass it down to his sons. Fortunately, when a certain little *robin* that lost something so precious so young, the lesson for Master Bruce had begun and would continue for a second so in need, he would take on *any* fight just to survive, and would, of course, extend to the small one they are carrying up the staircase of Wayne Manor as he sleeps the sleep of the innocent.

Alfred and Master Dick take his shoes off and manage pajama bottoms, tucking the little boy in with care.

Only once did he wake up slightly, blinking fuzzily without move his heavy head from the pillow.

“This is such a nice dream, Mr. Alfred.”

A gentle hand to his head, smoothing down his too long hair, “go back to sleep, Young Sir. We shall be here when you wake in the morning.”

And Timmy hums again, smiling, snuggling down into the comfortable mattress and pillow. He’s fine sleeping until morning, to keep the dream for as long as he *can* (and maybe....maybe it would be okay to just not have to wake *up*).

# Dr!Tim: Sub-Drop

Ah, I wanted to follow up this little thing because of reasons like *angst* and *hurt/comfort*. It’s all self-indulgent tho >.< Ah, I’ve read Sub/Dom fics but there’s so many ways to interpret the ‘drop’ so I might have completely screwed it up.

\*\*

His brain isn’t functioning at full capacity, tongue too thick in his mouth, “j-just a few minutes...I just—” and the drop *hits*.

He trails off to put all thought into *not* puking, into making his brain try to work against his body’s reaction. It’s the effect of abrupt absence of serotonin and dopamine in the brain, the feel good cocktail, causing his stomach to bottom out and roll with nausea, causing him to go crazily light-headed, promising one *hell* of a migraine later on. The shakes hit harder, making him shudder too hard against the door.

“—im? Check in, baby—”

But it’s muted and cottony.

(And it’s pathetic to want to be held right now when he’s the one that called the *whoa, there buddy*)

“I’m sorry,” stutters out again when he swallows back the burn of bile, “I...I just got dizzy. Not enough air. It’s fine, I just need a few minutes—I’m sorry, I just…”

He doesn’t hear the knob turn slowly, but gasps in a shaky breath when the pressure of the door against his back gets *real*.

“No, no, no, just—just chemical reactions. It’s fine, it’s *fine*,” *please don’t come in here and see me like this*. His eyes go to the solitary window over the sink, vaguely forming a *plan*.

However, the door is open enough for a hand to snake through and search out—

Fingers wrap around his wrist, making him jump a little and stare down, gaping, but he can’t stop *shaking* all over.

“I...I just…I’m *fine*,” he croaks out at the hand just *grounding* him from the dizzying sense of the floor falling out from under him.

More muted something and his eyes are just suddenly, stupidly *hot*, and he *knows* it’s only the imbalance of chemicals in his brain (*fear*). There’s no reason to be sick and shaky like this.

He’s been attacked by *real-life* *ninjas*, survived the Joker, out-smarted the Scarecrow, save a ton of people from bad guy ‘let’s blow up shit!’ parties, and yes, *yes*, he gets phone calls from *motherfucking ****space***.

There is *absolutely* no reason for this to *get to him* right now—

The hand on his wrist tugs with careful strength, making him move on autopilot.

“Tim? *Timmy*, yer not trackin’, Sugar. Listen ta me, yeah?”

“It’s *okay*, baby. You *are* fine. We’re right here with you—” and it’s Dick’s hand, darker against his with that Romani blood, pulling him to the crack in the door where they can peer at his averted face and wet eyes.

“It’s just *chemicals*,” he sits out helplessly, tangled in the sheet. “It’s just chemical physiological reactions from the lack of stimuli—” but he’s talking too fast, and he *knows it*, tries swallowing down the acrid taste of stomach acid.

Dick’s expression is firmly *unhappy*, dark eyes narrowed while Jay half-frowns over his shoulder.

“I’m *sorry*,” he tries again, “I just need a few minutes and—and we can start again, okay? I won’t—” testing the pull of Dick’s grip is really a *mistake* and does nothing to dislodge those fingers.

Jason is talking softly against Dick’s ear, easing them both down a notch so they both don’t go shoving the door open to tackle their third to the floor and holding him down until he actually *talks* to them. In a way, both of them are glad they’ve finally hit upon *something* that made Tim end the scene. To have him drawing back like, to see him *hide* and look *ashamed* this when they thought the relationship was *far* past this stage.

So, of course, they need to have a *plan*.

Dick is absolutely calm and methodical, “Tim. You’re going to get back from the door and let us come in. Do you understand, baby?”

*“Do you think he’ll be lonely while we’re gone?”*

*(“It’s all right, Mister Drake. You won’t be lonely with all the other children.”)*

(*But oh God, he ****was****. Even when the foster families inevitably took him *back*. “You won’t be alone anymore, Tim.” How dumb they all were, right?)*

It’s stupid how his eyes spill over, his body getting tight again, the air in his lungs not enough to really *breathe*.

“I...Timmy, I dream of the Pit sometimes,” Jay’s low voice breaks over the pseudo panic attack, “and I come awake *screamin’.* Ya know alla ‘bout it.”

And yeah, yeah he *does*. He’s been up close and *personal* for when the green takes over those eyes and it’s not *his* Jason looking at him.

Dick’s mouth works for a second, but Jason’s hand on his hip, the grounding touch, makes him clear his throat, lets him be able to say, “Tarantula… and-and Blockbuster. I’ll never be able to *escape* that, Tim.”

But he *knows* it, Dick. Knew it after one time he’d gotten *impatient*, shoved his oldest vigilante boyfriend down and straddled his hip, in a hurry to sink down and be *full*. Jason had seen Dick’s eyes go glassy with shock, realized the body under Tim’s thighs had gone...*still*. Until then, he hadn’t *known*, couldn’t understand why Jason just dragged him off and pulled Dick up into a hard hold, talking against his ear for long moments.

“We all gotch it, Sugar,” is Jay bringing both his boys back outta their own heads, “ain’t *no one* without something *fucked* in his past, you feel me? Me and Dickie got our hang-ups, just like ya gotch yers.”

He’s shaky about it, but opens his mouth to argue because Jay fucking *died* and Dick was-was *assaulted* (*raped*). They had *real *traumas, not something just *stupid* out of their brain pans, and…

Dick’s hand tightens on his wrist, makes him flinch just slightly and actually *look* up.

“Oh, Tim,” Dick sighs at the wet face and red eyes, the stubborn expression that is resolute *nope, this isn’t happening*. “Baby, you were there for us. Let us be there for you. *Please*?”

But Jay isn’t taking the easy route apparently and doesn’t wait for an answer. He reaches past Dick and starts pushing at the door, using his body to make Dick *move*.

And even if his body tightens in on itself, even if he gets his hand free to wrap his arms around himself (old habits, *protect the soft spots*), neither vigilante hesitate to bracket him on both sides, to loop their legs over one another, so his ass is right in the pocket of their laps, the two of them wrapping arms around him so fucking *tight* (no escape now, should’ve gone out the window while he had a *chance*).

That plan goes up in smoke when he finally realizes Jay might have a point about how well he isn’t tracking because he blinks and Jay is trying to get him to drink something sugary out of a straw, brows drawn together in worry.

Dick is softly talking against the nape of his neck, rocking them both in a gentle sway while promising they *absolutely* would not hold anything against him. He was so *strong*, so unbreakable. Didn’t he already *know* that?

He’s got his favorite nerd shirt on and a pair of fluffy pj pants (ones he totally stole from Steph, no lie), the dizzying haze finally letting up and the *agony* in his chest loosening just a little bit at a time.

When he finally does drink the juice, both vigilantes squeeze and pet him, hold on *tight* so he knows they’re *there*. (“*It’s okay, we’re right here, Timmy. We here with you, baby.” While he shakes the fuck *apart*.)*

And even if he wants to *scream* (“Stop, *stop!* Don’t *look* at me.”), he can’t with them bracketing him *in*, the same way he does when Jay’s heart is hammering in his chest and he grinds his back teeth into dust, or when Dick’s eyes are hazy with old pain, his fists clenching hard enough to *break* so he *doesn’t* *have to*.

When Tim finally gets enough to tell them *why* he called the scene, can admit how fucking scared he was they might actually *leave* him (and never...never come *back*), they don’t guffaw and overlook him, don’t belittle him, don’t berate him to know *better*. Maybe because of the life they lead, they *understand* how fear isn’t something to understand *logic* and reasoning. It’s not something that can be *dealt* with like a case or an insane bad guy with a guy.

So, instead, they hold on and work him down from the potentially harmful sub-drop, apologize for not realizing, for going too far into the scene, praising him for having the courage to call a stop to it before it went *too far*.

And when he finally swims out of the shakes and nausea, when he can grip Dick’s bicep and Jay’s rough hand, the hoarse, “*thank-you*,” is more for what they *didn’t* say.

# Dr!Tim: London Bridge is Falling Down

So, I’m covering *three* in one with this little thing. Anon, Arkaedia, and a second Anon. We needed bad ass Tim, some hurt!Tim, and some soft and fluffy. Welp, here’s my attempt and making it all come out in the *wash*.

(FYI: @satire, @poison, and @sky-is-a-lie are all my babes to read this when the muse was being *mean*)

\*\*

Ride-alongs are his *and now for something completely different*.

It’s a chance to get out of the hospital, to ride with the EMTs, to take a chance looking for bolt holes and hidey places where criminals, victims, and nice vigilantes might, you know, *hang out*. (And if he totally has those spots mapped from his time running the streets of Gotham, well, then there’s *that.*) Besides, Kerry and Hailey, his partners for the night (and the same EMTs that kind of *knew* the night company he kept since *that one time* with Robin almost *dying* had him flagging down the ambulance for a bag of O pos), were so *on to him* about having a boyfriend that he’s having fun making them guess all the deets.

*(But, he did tell them it’s “boyfriends” just to hear Kerry’s mad cackle and get a high-five from Hailey.*)

There had been a few instances of need, shortness of breath with a little chest pain and numbness on the side down in the Narrows (yeah, he *knows* meth when he sees the effects, thanks). A kitchen fire in the upper east side neighborhood (*his parents had lived here once, lived this *life*)* with a bewildered housewife looking ashamed at leaving the oven on while he bandaged her hand and suggested a trip to the ER for just in *case*. (Of course not, Harold wouldn’t *hear* of it).

Even *cooler*, they’d received a call to swing by Arkham Asylum to check up on Nora Fries (even though he’s been one of the doctors permitted inside the Asylum, and one of the fewer that has taken the weak vitals of Mr. Freeze’s *wife*, it’s still a creepy place to go) when the power grid blipped for a few seconds. Any time the complex machinery keeping Nora alive in suspended animation has *any* kind of issues, the administration contacted one of four physicians in the Tri-State area Fries will allow anywhere near her.

Luckily, Dr. Drake is already enroute.

Kerry is talking over the radio to the on-call guards at Arkham as they’re half-way across Trigate Bridge, and Hailey is detailing her Princess Serenity Cosplay for this year (and *yes*, she has *the wig* because some people do it *right*. He used to LARP when he had time, so they have plenty to bond about)—

When the first explosion rocks the ambulance, Kerry jerks the wheel hard, the instincts bred from running headlong into typical Gotham *catastrophes* shown when the ambulance balances precariously on two wheels for long, heart-stopping moments before slamming back down on the pavement, bouncing all three of them around.

The consistent traffic around them, however, not so lucky.

“*Hold on!” *Kerry turns around to the doctor and second EMT, eyes wide and knuckles white on the wheel.

The first car slamming into the side is poor timing, hitting hard enough to throw the ambulance into oncoming traffic in the other lane, supplies flying all over the place. The next hit is enough to break the windshield, which lets in the sound of screaming and shit just *breaking *on the bridge all around them.

Even after a toss into some very painful metal cabinets with supplies, Tim is just dazed enough to pick out some very, *very* not good sounds of heavy iron *bending*. He sucks in a breath because all the evidence is *there*.

So many people are going to *die* (and they might be thrown in that mix). The ambulance is five miles out from Gotham and another three from the island housing Arkham with a *whole* lot of Atlantic right under them. If supports have been blown, then it’s only a matter of *time* how long the structure would *hold*.

They had to get people off as fast as possible; they had to assess as many wounded as they could and* get off this fucking bridge*.

“Everyone all right?! Kerry! Tim!” Hailey shoves the gurney off her legs, swimming up from a pile of gauze pads. Dazed but functional because he’s the only one in the ambulance that’s come to realize *oh shit time* has kicked in.

(Then again, he *is* the pet doctor to a horde of terrifying vigilantes. That just gives him an *edge* in the ‘blow shit up’ department.)

He climbs up and over the front seat, looking at the blood on Kerry’s face from the glass.

“We need to get out there,” the EMT is saying, hands shaky. “Whatever happened, people are going to be *hurt*—”

“Explosion,” he fills in both EMTs in while flicking a penlight in her eyes, happy for *no concussion* and, you know, being *alive* (for now). “Something exploded on or under the bridge. We need to assess who we can, load up, and get the hell off as soon as possible.”

“I’ll phone Dispatch, but I have no idea how the mainland wouldn’t have heard it already,” Kerry shakes herself, finally lets go of the wheel. The soft burr of accent soothes over the resounds *crash* and sharp, biting sound of twisting metal. He grins a little and quickly puts a few pieces of tape against the cut high on her forehead, glad there was no concussion to worry about. Once they get outside the ambulance doors, though, all bets are *off*.

“Supplies,” Hailey mutters to herself, snatches up satchels, stuffing them full so each EMT can carry two-at-a-time. As usual, Doc Drake has his own bag around his shoulders, impressively staying with him through that little *shift* in gravity. “Okay! We get out and start prelims. What’s our radius? I mean, we can’t cover the whole *bridge*.”

“As far as we can,” he takes his time to scan outside the broken windshield, already reaching for the door, “I’m going to take off, get as far as I can, so don’t wait for me. You two take as many as this rig can hold and get to safety. I’ll hitch a ride with someone before it goes.”

“I don’t like that idea,” Hailey fills in, coming up between the chairs to give her partner a once-over, handing over supplies.

Kerry seconds *that* sentiment, “there’s no guarantee, you’ll get another *ride*, Tim!”

“Someone needs to get between both points.” And *yes*, it’s reasonable considering half the bridge if pretty much *gone* and the other half is full of overturned cars, people panicking, broken concrete, and more chaos than *he’s* ever seen (and that? Is saying something). “There’s probably another ambulance somewhere further down anyway, so it’s fine. If *not*, then there’s plenty of functional cars already on the road.” His jaw *tight*, tingling with *get ready, *Tim eyes the two EMTs also with game faces *on*. (Really, all the fuckery that goes on in Gotham *bonds* people.) “We get out, get who we can, hit up as much trauma care as possible, and get the hell *gone*. Agreed?”

Hailey grins at him, heads to the back of the rig, readying the gurney to pull out. Kerry just sighs a little and gives him a decidedly arched brow, “sorry, Doc, doesn’t look like you’ll be gettin’ that easy night after all.”

“Believe it or not, I’m okay being *busy*,” he banters back so they both have a second of *normal* before the *time to rock*, and lets her call in to dispatch.

He takes a breath to prepare himself for whatever he’s going to face, and finally rips open the passenger side door as Hailey knuckles-down and shoves the damaged back doors open right with him, throwing themselves into the fray.

As expected, it’s fucking *chaos*.

The Trigate Bridge is the third longest on the East Coast, spanning from Gotham, breaking off to have a double-lane highway to the smaller island housing Arkham, and continuing on to the mainland near Somerset (thus *Tri*gate, three directions). The explosion(s) were apparently meant to take out key supports and *maybe *send thousands of people into the water below with a mass of debris and oncoming *death*. As far as he can see, spans of the bridge on the north side and east have felt the *burn*. (Two sides the bridge were set with explosive charges…) Literally. Hunks of bridge and probably crucial structure have already been sacrificed to the murky water below, and the loud, creaking groan is only a punctuation on how close the whole thing is from giving way. There’s no way to assess how close they were to impending *doom*.

However, the next layer of *oh shit* are the vehicular accidents lining the bridge due of the explosion. On both sides of the ambulance, there’s screaming, burning, crumbling *holy ****fuck**** *going on.

Tim takes in a deep breath, the smoke starting to fill the air, gauging the areas of most need that he can immediately see. The plan starts to form even as he’s tapping the special clip on his name tag. (The one Dick switched out last week and thought he wouldn’t, you know, *notice*.)

“Okay, Kerry gets to stay close and prep as much room as we’ve got,” the doctor turns in a circle, trying to place the immediate *need* during their very critical time window. “Hailey, take north. I’m going down the east side toward Arkham. Try to get anyone that can drive to start heading back to Gotham. Take anyone that needs transport, stabilize as you can.”

The two EMTs are wide-eyed, looking at the aftermath with professional assessment since horror and fear have to be on the backburner. Hailey squeezes his shoulder before she’s off to the blue SUV turned on it’s top and a teenagers trying to get out the window.

“Promise me!” Kerry snatches his arm before he even *moves*, “get off this bloody thing before it goes!”

“Scouts honor,” his vision narrows down, mind working with all the evidence and perceptions.

“All right! See you on the other side,” and Kerry is off too, slinging the satchel securely over her shoulder and moving, already gloving up, fast and efficient even with the *owfuck*. She’s checking on the driver of the car that hit the ambulance in the first place, taking his vitals and pulling the crushed door open with strength alone. A grim smirk is the last thing he’s *got*, and Tim takes off in the opposite direction, running full tilt through the wreckage, climbing over busted concrete and overturned, empty cars, checking them out before he moves on.

With the blood pounding in his ears and screams echoing all around them on the open water, he’s trying to keep an eye on the damaged bridge, check structural failure so he know about how much *time* he’s got before more important pieces would start breaking off. (*Far out he sees the line of white ships that could very well be the Coast Guard on the way because a little bit of *help here* would be just *fucking **stellar***).*

He’s already gloved up by the time he gets to the car hanging perilously close to the edge of the damaged bridge, the skid marks telling the story on *how* that happened. A bigger sedan had knocked into the little car, sending it skittering through the protective barriers and almost over. The thing is only precariously out of the water by sheer *willpower* and the rusty bumper snagged on a broken support line. The driver is *terrified*, one hand extended over the back where a small, blonde child (*like Layla*) is clutching a worn-out teddy.

(*Cass is on after school babysitting duty. It’s *fine*, they’re fine. Dick is probably going to be called in to the Police Station once they hear about this*. *Jay might have woken up with the explosions. Steph is at Mercy and everyone is *fine*.*)

“It’s okay, it’s okay,” he talks fast, stepping carefully, already reaching the back door. “I’m right here, and i’m going to get you out. I need you to hurry, okay?”

“Mommy!” The child screams out when the car inches forward, tilting down *more* to the churning waters below.

“Karmen,” the wide-eyed mother puts on *the voice*, “take his hand and get out of the car.You need to get out *Right*. *Now.*”

The kid is panicking, and he *completely* understands, but, well, *impending doom*. The wrong move, the wrong breath, and the thing is going over, taking them and him with it. He moves carefully, gingerly, sweat making it’s way down his back with how he maps out the right way to keep the thing from going over. “It’s okay, Karmen, right? Hi, My name’s Tim.”

“H-Hi, Doctor Tim,” the child whimpers with tears in her eyes as she’s squishing further back in the leather seat, looking from him to the Atlantic Ocean through the windshield.

“What’s your buddy’s name, Karm?” He gestures to the stuffed animal she’s clutching like a lifeline.

“C-Carl. He’s Carl the Bear.”

“That’s cool. I used to have a Bear I called Robin. Made him a mask and everything.”

She blinks at him and her expressions changes into something like Steph’s right before she calls him the *Nerd-Wonder* (and *yes*, he’ll take that title, thank-you very much).

But it’s fine. It’ll be easier to her to jump if she’s laughing at him instead of terrified.

He gingerly pops open both doors on the driver’s side, tries to keep the weight dispersed to the back of the car, “Okay, Karm, time to listen up. I want you, Carl, and your mom to jump out when I give you the signal. I bet you can jump really good, right?”

“Y-Yes. I-I’m a good jumper.”

“Awesome. I need you to *jump* the very *best* jump ever, okay? Can you try that for me?”

But her eyes are filling up again, going from her mom to the churning water and back to him. “I-I’m scared, Tim! I’m too *scared.*”

“I know you are, but it’s okay. As long as you do what I say, you’re going to be fine.” And it’s a crazy balancing act to keep the doors open, try to make sure the weight doesn’t shift enough to send the car plummeting the long and painful way down into the water.

“Please,” the mother gasps out, eyes wet and dazed from fear, “please save my baby girl. *Please* don’t let her drown.”

“We’re working on saving you both. So when she jumps, so do you. I’m right here, and I’m going to grab you, so just Get. Ready.”

His hands are out, his other eye on the mother’s trembling hands as she gingerly unclicks her seatbelt.

“Mommy,” Karmen whimpers again, a terrified little girl.

“I *love you*, sweetheart. I love you so much,” and the crack in her voice is enough to make his chest tight, to make sure he’s *got them*. “Get ready to jump to Tim, okay? Mommy’s so proud of you, my brave girl.”

When those eyes came back to him, wet but *resolute*, he knew they found the next kick-ass vigilante someday.

“Okay… *Jump!*”

He snatches with both hands, *fast*, pulling, throwing the three of them *away*. Mother and daughter watch as the car goes over, gripping each other *tight*, and Tim is *absurdly* glad for quick thinking and shit like *gravity*.

A rudimentary line of cars is flowing off the bridge at slow speeds, pausing to let others on foot get in. Carrying Karmen and gripping her mother’s arm, Tim flags down a truck with a few people already in the back. He lowers the tailgate and holds his charges up for waiting hands to pull the small family to safety.

“Tim!” Karmen calls as the truck pulls off, the strangers checking over her and her mother for serious injuries, “Tim! Thank-you! *Thank-you!*”

But her hero disappears into the smoke from the burning bridge, she only catches his back as he runs further into the crisis, one hand thrown up over a shoulder in a *bye-bye*, before he’s out of sight.

Four people are trying to push back a car pinning a young woman to concrete debris. He’s one of those people, muscles straining with effort. When she’s free, one of them has a working vehicle ready for transport.

(Gotham never ceases to *amaze him*. In a city usually overrun with every flavor of *psychopath*, you have to be resilient and adaptable. The people, however, always seem to come *together* in times of crisis and crazy assholes trying to demolish the city. It’s amazing when things like kicking bad guy ass brings out the best in people.)

Tim does as much trauma care as he realistically *can*, talking quickly to one of the people riding with her, giving rapid instructions for her to tell responders off the bridge.

The next breath, he’s pulling up metal and concrete, yelling with the effort, forcing his tired muscles to give *more* when some relatively unharmed civilians attack him with *thank God* hugs. The little blonde boy looks dazed, blinking with blood in his eyes from a nasty scalp wound, but remembers his name is Leo and he’s ten, Dr. Tim.

It takes a second to lift the kid up and brace the Father with his other arm, the group making a beeline for an empty vehicle that might still have keys in it. (None of them judge him when he cracks into the steering column and hot wires the damn thing. Because, you know, he has other *hobbies*.)

In no time, he’s using some pieces off a ‘79 Honda Civic to immobilize a broken leg, splints it like a *boss.*

Charlie is seven and has a better iPhone than *he* does. The bus full of first graders on their field trip out of Gotham are calm, but the bus is done for. He manages to rope three transports, checking quickly over the class, and helping their shaky teacher get on the flatbed. Charlie give him a low five and they’re gone while he pulls the first aid kit out of the bus for *just in case*.

Streams of cars are passing him by, some stragglers helping others, and it’s moving fluidly enough that he can guess emergency crews are on the other end, flagging traffic to get the evacuation *moving*. He’s caught by the arm a few times, but just puts the usual amount of *authority* to make people thinks he’s in charge of something before he takes off to the next cry for help.

Climbing over a ten car pile-up is a tricky enough business with things pretty much *holy unstable, Batman*.

He slices his damn hand open on a broken window, loses his grip for a breathless, heart-pounding second. On the way down, he manages to tape gauze over the bleeder and see that his phone—

The screen is cracked to all hell.

*Fuck*. He can’t even call for a very nice *pick-up* right about now.

The bridge gives an abrupt groan, a sound reverberating down his spine, making the *oh shit* feeling swell in his gut, the hair on the back of his neck stand on end, and every instinct in his body screaming to *run*. He tries to move (*but there’s nowhere to go*). The hard twang echoes when a few of the supporting cables lining the bridge *snap*, iron bending dangerously, concrete on either side starting to crumble and *break*.

He can’t throw himself out of the way fast enough, gets knocked off his feet, slams into crumbling debris while more falls around and on top him. A hard chunk pins him, agonizing, terrifying. His leg is wedged by iron, sharp, biting pain from his calf and the torn, jagged bicep trying to lever enough strength to shift *something* to free him without bringing more down on him. With other frightened screams and groans of *almost giving up* happening further down the bridge, he doesn’t have *time* for a whole lot of this *bullshit*.

He calculates fast and furious, gauging the stability of the pile he’s under and starts kicking at the concrete with his other foot viciously. Sweat and blood makes his gloves slippery, makes him pant with a strike of panic while he pushes *harder* against the shit blocking out the light.

Tim has to shake himself, yell at the stupid *fucking debris* (Damian will *never* let him live it down if this is how he dies. *Seriously*). One more hard kick and a piece crumbles enough to get his damn calf through, gives him the leverage to shove the piece at his back away, climb up and out, to cough and gasp in a breath of dirty Gotham air.

There’s a few sparse people still running. One stops long enough to help him out, pulling him quickly with both arms locked around Tim’s upper chest. “It’s going to collapse! You’ve got to get out of here!”

“I have to see if there’s anyone else. Get going!” Tim gives him a shove and takes a long moment to assess. He still has time. Dammit, he still has *time*. So he takes off again, making his leg work, holding the bag to his side, unconsciously fishing out a new pair of gloves.

He hits the halfway point where the bridge bisects, going toward Arkham or toward Somerset, glad he can’t see anyone in the long, damaged span of twisted, falling iron and crumbling supports.

Still, he’s limping, dropping some random blood spots from his shredded calf while he checks abandoned cars and piles of debris for a last, frantic attempt. Even with the leg as it is, he can start back now and make it in less than fifteen minutes, maybe even get one or two more that might have been missed. He can still *try*, dammit—

But as luck would have it, his calculations are off, and he runs *out of time*.

His heart takes an abrupt journey to the back of his throat when the heavy *twang* from earlier echoes again. Faster, *heavier* as the support cables give way in rapid succession. The tension finally enough to start the unavoidable collapse. Helpless, he’s alone for a far as he can see, watching the cables snap, each one flipping sharply out of control because of the tension, slamming into remaining cars and breaking up more concrete. The echo makes a roll of dread hit him stomach, the things snapping all the way back to main Gotham and the inevitable destruction ensues as sections of the bridge start to crumble at the lack of support. A large section twenty feet in front of him gives a sick, metallic scream before the whole damn thing drops a foot down, and the loud *snap* catches cottony as all he can do is watch the section break apart and drop down into the ocean.

*Can’t go that way*.

Swallowing down his thundering pulse, his hearing goes wonky even before he’s spinning, throwing up his arms when the progression keeps going, snapping cables right past him. He’s not fast enough to dodge a mess of concrete from a flying cable, taking the heavy hits to his back, trying to keep his feet under him.

The horror movie moment when he looks over his shoulder and sees the rest of the bridge for the next mile finally *give way*, the concrete and supports under the thing cracking, crumbling, falling into the ocean (*no way for the Coast Guard to make it anywhere *near* here*), puts enough *fear* that he can keep his feet under him. The only way to go is toward Arkham *(the horrible irony, being safe at the asylum known to house crazies of all flavors)*, and he makes himself *run*. He has to try staying ahead of the crumbling concrete quickly gaining on him. And even with the pain in his calf, the agony in his back, the burn in his lungs and thighs, the way his eyes are getting *wet*, making the way blurry and unfocused, even if it is so pathetically, sadly *useless* because there’s no way he’s going to outrun *this*.

He’s going down in the murky Atlantic, buried under cars and shopping bags with milk and eggs, under girders and cables and concrete. He’s going to be down there with anyone else that didn’t make it off, and he couldn’t even say goodbye to Dick or Jay or Steph or Ives because his goddamn *phone* is busted. He couldn’t say he is so fucking *sorry* about this. That no matter *what*, he loves them. They are his *family*, all he has in the world, and they are the *best*. And if he could *only*—

There isn’t *time* now, and the realization, the fucking *agony* of it strikes him as the ground under him gives a sick lurch, slamming down abruptly on the weakening lower support beams, giving him some kind of false *hope* while at the same time, bringing him to his *knees*.

He holds his breath, shaking, bent over, eyes wet, and just please, *please*.

He doesn’t want to leave them.

A drop of blood from his cut cheek hits the pavement and groaning metal tells him it’s so far past *too late*. Gravity falls out from under him as the supports under this section of the bridge finally give way. The immediate weightlessness makes his stomach lurch sharply and fear strikes in his spine, getting him on his feet for the last-ditch attempt from his brain pan has him leaping up on a bumper, breaking the windshield in his mad dash without enough breath to really *make it*.

But again, he’s got nowhere left to go when the world falls out from under him, and his heart gives a hard, painful beat.

His brain blanks out when he’s hanging suspended in mid-air for terrifyingly still moments caught in time, and everything is in a crazy kind of slow motion; the sounds of the world around and under him are muted and cottony, only his panting breaths echoing in his ears. The only thing he can see is Dick’s face relaxed in sleep, and Jay’s eyes, so *blue*, when he’s laughing—

The choking sob makes it up out of his throat, spilling out instead of *I love you, I love you and I’m sorry*.

Because he *is*. *Fuck, he ****is***.

Somewhere along the way, somewhere between a dying vigilante on his fire escape and *now*, he’d come to *believe* in them wholeheartedly. Knew they’d never abandon him, never hurt him, never *die* on him even if they risked their lives every night. He believed in their strength and their convictions, believed they would fight through *Hell itself* to make it back to him.

They would never leave him the last one left *standing*.

(And how fucking *ironic* is it that *he’s* the one going to leave them? The Joker would really get a kick out of it.)

His chest aches with the revelation (*or the fact he literally *can’t get enough *air)*, and *God*, he only wanted to a few minutes, a few *seconds* even, just so they would *know*, so he could just tell them—

(*Even though they were both *his* Robins, he’s in love with Jason and Dick, not Robin, not Red Hood, not Nightwing...and now they’ll never *know*. It’s too fucking *late*.*)

Everything.

The world comes back abruptly when the weight of his body takes over and he starts to drop, his medical bag caught up at his side.

Already grieving for them, for his only *family*,Tim closes his eyes while the sounds of cars and debris, of shit breaking and falling, of the fucking *world* ending in the depths of the ocean, all of it infiltrate, give him a sense of how fast it’s going to be over. There’s always a *chance*, always a plan, but with his leg torn up, he won’t be able to swim with enough strength to get back to the surface before his air runs out, taking into account he doesn’t get crushed by the pressure and debris already down there—

(But...but at least, his brain does him a solid in the seconds before he’s going to die, just a little reminder that he should be *grateful* he’s had them, to think about *all* of them, and all the good times, all the love and laughter, all the things they gave him with hearts open. At least....at least he *had that much*.)

And he’s not sure if his eyes are wet because he’s crying or because of the air, but the pain, the fear, the sensation of falling, it’s Death opening up its’ great maw, ready to chew him up and spit out his slightly damaged soul.

(*I love you. I’ve never had anyone to love like this. I’ve never *wanted* to love like this, but now that I ****have****, you two are all I never knew I needed.*)

He hopes they don’t mourn, he hopes they keep *moving*, he hopes they take care of each other. He hopes they remember him without remorse or regret. He hopes he doesn’t make some imaginary list of things they never *finished*.

He hopes they *know* without hearing the words one last time.

(And fuck, now that *is* him crying, isn’t it?)

The rapid *blast*, a sonic boom, hits his senses, cutting through the *thousand* things in his head, even with the air rushing around him dampen everything.

Tim doesn’t open his eyes until the last second (*because who really wants his last sight to be of his family)*, gasping in hard enough to be fucking painful because it’s like he’s a nine-year-old kid again, standing down in alleys or crouched on roof tops clutching his camera. It’s the same *awe* and amazement because at this very second, he’s watching the Dark Knight in all his fearsome power *fly*.

The silhouette has lept out of the dark shadow against the sun, thrown himself out of the plane without a thought, the tracking signal bringing him *right here* where he feared the young doctor would be in the middle of the mass crisis.

(He didn’t need Dick’s panicking tone to get his ass in gear because Tim’s signal *wasn’t* *moving* *off the bridge* by the time the first sections broke apart.)

Tim’s lungs scream for air he can’t seem to get, his eyes going wide as the Batman swoops down a flawless arch, arms tight at his sides to be even more aerodynamic and forces the speed of the fall, determined Tim isn’t going to hit the damn water. (*Hold on, Tim. ****Hold on.***)

He’d yell if he could, tell B it’s too close, there’s no way he could pull up in time, to save *himself*. (Gotham would always need saved, would always need *him*.) But no words can escape and his eyes are blurry enough that the dark shadow is fuzzy, the whiteouts gone for electric blue eyes. He can’t even gasp as the Batman reaches him mid-death drop, catches him with an arm that has to be made of iron.

The abrupt change in direction almost makes him vomit, only strength of *will* keeping him from painting the vigilante’s back with stomach juice.

Even though his brain pan is fried, he gets handfuls of leather and Kevlar, fists *tight* his shaky hands into the cape while he tries to get his air back and hides himself, huddled against all that *strength*.

He might have been more terrified (since, you know, imminent *death*) than he let on because he has *no clue* how they’re just suddenly *in a plane*, sitting his shaky ass down on one of the seats in the back while B is kneeling down with his leg in both gloved hands. B must have taken his satchel off, laid it down somewhere, and the arm of his scrubs is torn open to the bleeder on his bicep.

His mouth opens, closes wordlessly because he’s trying *so hard* to say it, “*thank-you for coming for me.”*

“Calm down,” is a little less *the night* than in his usual dealings with the Batman, “you’re going into shock.” And B doesn’t wince for the obvious damage done to Tim’s leg, but it’s a *close thing*. Instead, he is very *relieved* he’s not going to have to be the one to tell his sons their significant other met his end at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

The Batman’s (*Bruce’s*) voice gives him a little bit of *air* back, just enough to wheeze, “th-thanks...for the save.”

Still, he’s blinking rapidly, shaking too much, hitting the wrong side of adrenaline and fear, wrapping his arms around himself to try and stop it.

“The Coast Guard is already on site, taking care of people. So far, the fatality numbers are incredibly low for an incident of this magnitude. I’m sure you played a hell of a part in that.”

But Tim’s still on the *mindblown* side of things, woozy and light-headed, still not feeling the real *owfuck* of the sitch yet to say much. The leg of his scrubs is finally just ripped away so they can both look at the raw hamburger he’d been trying to *run* with. “Hn. The boys aren’t going to be happy about this, Tim.”

“I…” *The boys. Oh God, he’s going to see Dick and Jay and flip the utter fuck *out. “I-It’s-it’s okay.”

Inside the cowl, B arches a brow (*oddly enough, that’s what Robin might say. Any of them.*)* *“That’s the adrenaline talking. You’ll feel it soon enough.” B turns just slightly, “Batcomputer. Alert Agent A. We need prep for an incoming.”

He gets a little less fuzzy as the whole *alive* thing sinks in. So, time to make his brain switch gears from perpetual *screaming* to *oh, who’s the bad guy of the week again?*

“Anniversary,” he tells the kneeling vigilante, “*B*, it’s the *anniversary*.”

The cowl pauses in looking over his injured leg and slowly moves up until those *eyes* are on him, gears turning.

“Sal Maroni’s trial was ten years ago *today*.” His voice is hoarse, but *dammit*, he’s *right on this one,* leans forward enough to grip the dangerous gauntlets in one shaking hand. “It’s...it’s too good for Harvey Dent to pass up. He had the bridge set with charges, and there’s another one. He’s going to set a second one because that’s how he *works* with his shitty traps, and you have to *find it*, B. You have to...”

And it’s a crazy thing, seeing the Batman *smile*.

“Dick told me you were good,” is a calmer voice, one laced with *amusement*. “I contacted Gordon hours ago when I suspected Two-Face would have something devastating on the roster for tonight. Police crews have been combing the city and all his old hideouts while I’ve been researching in the Cave. He only sent the clue to GCPD an hour ago, and if Dick hadn’t been on shift, I wouldn’t have gotten it in time to stop the Robinson Bridge from blowing up already.”

Tim blinks, leaning down almost in B’s *face*, staring into those eyes while his brain catches up.

*No other hurt civilians. Damn...the day is starting to look up.* Well, you know, *World’s Greatest Detective*, of *course* he would have figured it out in time.

“O...Oh.”

B presses his shoulder, casual strength making him sink back into the chair.

“Again, good work, Tim... I’m not going to stop being surprised about your “hobbies,” am I?”

“I’ll try to keep you riveted.” But he’s sinking down with things like blood loss, trauma, and utter fucking *relief*, tongue getting too thick in his mouth to be especially *witty*.

“Do that. It’s a nice departure from the normal psychos I deal with. And by the way, don’t move. We’re going to do a full assessment once we land. I’m sure Alfred is already wearing a path in my Cave.”

Tim blinks, tries to nod but the motion is a little jerky and uncoordinated. Conversation apparently over because the Doctor is sinking deeper into shock and has lost enough blood (for a civilian) that the vigilante is *concerned*, B stands up and fishes a blanket out of a storage compartment, wraps it around Tim’s shaking form.

“Just relax and try to stay awake. We’ll be home soon.” And the cape swishes with a sigh of sound, being easy while the plane rumbles under his ass.

(He probably imagines a gloved hand resting on the top of his head before B stridges back to the controls and takes the plane off autopilot. Not that it matters because his brain is pleasantly all about *white noise* when he starts to crash from the adrenaline overdose.)

And since he’s very, *very* safe in the plane, by himself while B’s back is turned, he fades in and out, holding the blanket to his chest tightly, his eyes filling up and clearing out at odd intervals. He’s about forty percent with it, drifting in and out with calculations and diagnosis from the bridge skimming over his thoughts, taking completely by surprise when the cockpit is *invaded* by whirling tornados of *concerned boyfriends*.

(*His heart picks up, and Tim tries to shake off lethargy and strain because they’re both so fucking ****beautiful**** right now*.)

“Tim! Timmy!!” Dick looks haggard, his eyes astoundingly *blue*.

Jay is right on his ass, jaw tight with obvious worry, “Jesus*fucking*Christ, Sugar.”

Dick is still in his uniform, tilting Tim’s face up to look in his dazed eyes with such utter *relief* he shakes a little with it, those steady hands weak for just a moment in time (*I love you. God, I love you*). Jay leans in around that hand and presses a fast, hard kiss to the top of his head, and goes for the blanket, *knows *he’s looking for something. He gets *jackpot* when the scrubs beneath are blood-stained, torn and dirty, making Jay’s heart beat just a little faster.

“*B*, what the *fuck?* Couldn’t cha at *least* bandage our boy up a lil bit?!” He bites it out sharper than intended, but his boy ain’t looking good, and the last images O managed to get off the bridge cameras as they went down is the mound of debris falling right on top a kid in scrubs. He and Dick had only been reigned in by Dami and Alfred with appropriate *threats* of tying them down should they even *try it*. (He can take Demon, but Alf? *Nope*. That’s a fight he’s always gonna lose.)

“We weren’t far.” B defends lightly, pushing his cowl off and kneeling by Tim’s feet again, unabashedly gripping an ankle to stretch the leg out of the blanket so the *owfuck* can air out. “I also wanted Alfred to look at this before I did anything.”

“Oh my *God,* that’s a lot of blood.” Dick is now even *more* concerned, latching on *tight* and pressing him close.

“Damn *right it is*.” Jay and B exchange *the look*.

“It’s okay,” he mumbles against Dick’s hand on his jaw, staring dazedly up, eyes sluggishly sliding to Jay. “I’m okay.” Because, dammit, looking at them, being absurdly fucking *grateful* for this, for *them*, everything is really just…

Fine.

“Yeah, Timmy, just *fine*. Right here with us, ain’t cha?” Jay crouches down, and he’s careful, *easy* about it when he takes a wrist and gently unwinds the dirty, frayed gauze to the nice slice taken out of his hand.

“Fuck.” Because that ain’t good. Timmy’s a *surgeon*, lives by his damn hands. “We need ta getcha bandaged up. Let Alf gedda lookit that leg.” Jay shoos Dick back so he can wind both arms around their civilian sweetie and lift him, blanket and all while B holds the leg up and stable, walking back without a hitch with the doctor between them.

And laying there in Jason’s arms, it gives Tim plenty of time to stare up at his profile, trace the line of jaw and the crooked line of nose with his eyes and be utterly *grateful.* So, so *grateful*.

(*I’ll never deserve you, but I’ll never stop *trying *either*.)

Alfred and Damian are monitoring the clean-up from the bridge, leaving the live footage as Jay and B ease Tim down to the medical gurney. It’s second nature to press his mouth to the top of the doctor’s head while B just smirks to himself and lets Dick slide around them to be on Tim’s other side.

Jason steps away to scrub and glove fast while Dick stays holding on a little *too* desperately and Alfred begins preliminaries. Dami does his usual, “*tt*,” and goes back to monitor the sitch (but the little asshole always looks *back* when he thinks they don’t know any better.)

Once B is satisfied Timmy is in good hands, he starts up with the search for Harvey himself and tracks the police reports Dick happened to copy while they were hot off the printer.

Jay is absurdly careful, even by *Alfred’s* standards as he stitches the slice in that precise hand and feverently hopes he’s not doing more damage.

Slightly slurry, tired with strain now that the adrenaline and other stimulants in his system have worn off (*chemicals balancing*, he thinks slowly, *and added opioids because it took a bridge collapsing to admit he was completely in *love* with these two. Fuck, is he really *that *dense?)*, he answers Dick’s careful questions as well as he can, rambles on about the car pile-up, the people he hoped were able to get help, the sound of the cables snapping (*that’s a sound he’s never going to forget*), the new iPhone he is *going* to get. To try staying out of the way without going too far, Dick lays his head beside Tim’s on the pillow and listens, squeezes his hand at the hard parts.

He vaguely remembers, “need...need to know if my EMTs...made it.”

“B is looking into it. We’ll have an update soon, okay? Just relax, baby.” It’s something soft and sweet to his muddled brain (*Alfred...must have given him something before starting on his leg. It’s a distant, dull thing.*)

“I should...I should go to the hospital—”

Jay pauses in finishing up with his bicep, raises a gloved finger to wag close to his face, “don’t cha even *try it*, pal. Steph already said they got the sitch under control.”

“Nu-uh, Timmy. You can’t even stand right now, so you’re going about as far as the main floor.”

“But…”

There’s no use in trying to argue. He’s one against four (and dammit, *five* because Damian is standing right by Dick’s hip, arms crossed over his chest and *glaring* at him for upsetting Grayson. Dammit, Drake, he’s a Robin that needs *Peace* and *Quiet*. Shut these fools up and *give in*.) Still, he says he can *walk*, really it’s *fine*, but Dick gives no shits getting to be the Bat carrying him this time, talking low and soothing while taking him upstairs in the Manor and pretty much deposits him in the utterly comfortable sitting room on the First Floor.

There are blankets and food, intermittent sleep between episodes of some reality show, and one or the other of his significant others close while the sedatives and antibiotics run their course in the first few hours post-injury hours.

Night must be falling because at some point, they’re talking about Two-Face and the second stage of his dastardly plan.

Later, he’ll vaguely remember his leg and other bandages taken off, being held in warm water while the dirt and dried blood is washed off with careful, patient hands (*someone is holding his leg out of the bathtub and being so absurdly *gentle). Hands in his hair to get the worst out, but the sedatives and painkillers make him useless to do much more than lay there and let it happen.

Time skips and he wakes up in the middle of a *massive* bed, half-aware enough to know his leg is on *fire* and just, *fuck* it all hurts.

There’s cameras apparently everywhere because Alfred and Jason are through the door before he even makes it to the edge of the bed. He gets one vigilante boyfriend crawling in with him to keep him down, pills to swallow and tucked back in (after the butler quickly assesses under the bandages).

Jay talks low and soothing against his temple, while the pain eases and things are just… good. So, so *good*.

\*\*

A few days later, Tim Drake is laid up on his couch with his healing leg wrapped up and elevated on a few pillows (even though the thing is really much better, Alfred, you don’t have to call for an update every day anymore. It’s...it’s really thoughtful though). Since his significant others have *that* kind of humor, *Scrubs* is playing on the television and a scattering of *things* are literally *everywhere*. A laptop is open on the floor with half a dissertation on the effects of Joker venom on cellular growth, a copy of *Catcher in the Rye* is stuffed between the cushions, a knitting project pokes him from a corner in odd moments, a manilla file folder with notes from the recent bout of tainted heroin is dangling just *oh so enticingly* on the stand closest to him (*dammit, Dick. Touche*).

Tim gives it ten minutes after his significant others leave for patrol (*finally*) before he looks around his empty living room with narrowed eyes and gingerly pulls his foot down off the cushions and plants it on the floor for *literally *the first time in a week.

(The first three days of being carried—even by *Damian*, believe it or not—were actually kind of nice. By day six, however, the *novelty* had worn very, very *thin*.)

So he might be grinning a little to himself since he sounded *completely* sincere when he promised Jay he was *not* going to get up while they were on patrol, that he had everything he could possibly want right here, and they had to get going because Gotham *needed* them. He made sure to catch the shadows falling from his fire escape before he even turned in his seat, gave it an extra few minutes for, you know, *just in case*.

So he’s got a hand on the arm of the couch, ready to shove himself to his feet and just *go* into his kitchen to make a damn cup of coffee *himself *thank-you very fucking much, ready to put weight on the injury.

(Really. He should have *known* better.)

The abrupt, jarring *slam* followed by the mini-tornado doesn’t even give him a *chance*.

The move is too fast for him to counter, but he’s just suddenly held high up against a broad chest, staring up in the blue eyes of Superboy, noting the obvious displeasure by his frown and drawn brows.

“You’ve got to be kidding me,” is more deadpan than he imagined, which just makes Superboy frown *that much harder*.

“Yo! Doc Drake!” Kid Flash is right there, holding a hand out for a serious high-five. “Totally nice digs, man. You? Are so obviously *in the mode*.”

The annoyed noise comes all the way up from his *toes* because this? This is just not even *necessary*.

“I can’t believe they’re wasting your time with this,” Tim groans aloud, doing such an epic facepalm the sound *echoes*. “It was just...a collapsing *bridge*, okay? I’m really fine.”

But when he looks up, *really looks*, something is just off because—

Superboy is in jeans and a plaid shirt, sporting a pair of wire-framed glasses. Kid Flash has no mask or body suit, but *huge* sneaker and—

*They’re not in the masks*.

He sucks in an abrupt breath and almost chokes.

“Oh yeah,” Superboy looks at KF all nonchalant. Just, you know, *NBD man*, *here’s our secret idents.*

“It’s cool.” KF shoos the shock away, “Dick said you were totally on the level, so we’re good showing you the real faces, you dig?”

“I...Are...are you sure you’re okay with this?” He can’t help but ask, looking from one to the other.

The super clone just shifts his weight to hold him up by one arm and stick the other by his chest, “Conner Kent.”

Dumbly, he shakes the hand, staring up at the blue eyes crinkling with mirth.

“Bart Allen. Time traveller *extraordinaire*.” Bart completely takes the initiative and shakes his hand *super fast*.

“Ah, yeah, wow...this is- this is *kick ass*. Welcome to my humble abode. Make yourselves comfortable.”

Both Titans give him wide grins and Conner turns to gently put him back down on the couch. Bart fluffs the pillows before his legs goes right back where it was before.

“I’m going to make some coffee,” he hedges, “you know, my leg is just *stellar*, and I should start putting weight on it—”

“Dick and Jason would probably kill us in horrible ways if we let you do that,” Conner shrugs easily, “so it’s okay, *I’ll* make you some coffee.”

The loud gasp by his television makes both of them crane around to see Bart going through his X-Box One games with huge eyes.

“*I want to play this one right now*,” the speedster bellows, swinging *Arkham Knights* around in one hand.

His inner nerd sparked, Tim grins a little viciously, “I already beat it, so all the cheats are unlocked.”

“Holy *shit*, man! I totally call Batman!”

“I want Harley Quinn,” Conner calls on his way to the kitchen, “if I’m going to watch someone run for an hour, I want it to be someone with a sweet ass.”

“Totally feel that,” Bart nods while he sets up the game. “How about you, Tim?”

“Robin,” he says quietly, “I’m usually Robin.”

He gives them both a *hundred* vigilante points because neither of them say a *word*.

# Dr. Tim!: Missing Scene from London Bridge is Falling

*@poison-basil needed this to finish off the bridge thing, and well, I can’t tell my babe *no*. Lol*.

He was pretty sure this was going to be a...*thing*. But, he could not have predicted it would be *this* bad.

“C’mon, Tim,” Dick is hanging effortlessly from the light fixture in the bedroom, clutching his scrub top like a lifeline, “they said you could have another *week*. You don’t...you *shouldn’t* go in yet. You need more time!”

From the floor, the annoyed doctor is standing shirtless with his arms crossed over his bare chest and his mussed hair all up in his face. The fact he’s frowning like a disapproving Dad should really tip off his vigilante boyfriends on how *not cool* this is.

“My leg is fine. There’s no need to wait,” he snaps back for what feels like the tenth time today. “Dick, we already *talked* about this.”

“That ain’t necessarily *accurate*, Sweetheart,” Jason drawls out from the doorway. His tactic is somewhat more...*subtle*. He’s mostly awake from a few hours of sleep after a night of vigilante-ing it *up*, had made sweet love with his boys before passing the fuck out for a few hours of well-deserved unconsciousness. Timmy getting out of the shower woke the both of them immediately because they still aren’t really *on board* with this, yeah?

So he *knows* the picture he presents, hair mussed and eyes half-mast with the remnants of sleep, warm and soft from blankets. His chest is bare, dotted with bruises, fine white lines of his scars breaking up the sleek and powerful muscle. The black briefs are heavy in the front while hugging the slight curve of his ass in the back. He *knows* when he talks, Tim’s eyes come back to him slouching against the frame, takes him *all* in.

(He sees the way his boy swallows before his cheeks get just a little *pink*. Such a good look on their Doc.)

So he straightens up, walks in their bedroom with his easy stride, all those muscles working in a terribly effective sync. His eyes are soft and fond when he wraps up their boy from behind, automatically rubbing over the healed bruises on Tim’s ribs and sides from the bridge attack. He gives *no fucks* about shit like being a dirty goddamned *cheat* when he presses against his boy’s bare back, just a reminder of how good it feels to be pressed *close*.

(Tim can feel the heat of skin and *oh God does he feel amazing*.)

“Pretty sure ya tol’ us y’ were good ‘nuff ta be on yer game.” Shamelessly, Jay leans down just a little to snuffle at the base of Tim’s neck sleepily.

“You both *knew* I planned on going back today.” Tim just has to keep his *resolve*. He absolutely *cannot* let these idiots think he needs to be (*protected*) coddled just because he’s a civilian. It’s really a good thing he’s never really told them about the crazy situations he got into *long* before he found Nightwing on his fire escape bleeding out (a very, *very* good thing, there’s only so much mother-henning *anyone* can take).

Dick finally jumps down to the ground, the move smooth and effortless. His hands tighten when Tim goes to take the scrub top from him, those electric blue eyes beseeching. “We’d feel so much *better* if you didn’t push yourself, Baby. You were right in the middle of a collapsing bridge. You almost *died*.”

*What now? Seriously?*

“When is that any different from what *you two* face every night?” He demands hotly, pulling the top out of Dick’s curiously suddenly-lax grip. “It’s *Gotham*, Dick. Bad things happen to good people all the time, but it’s people like *us* that have to keep up the effort.”

“Not at ‘cher expense, Sweetheart,” Jay contradicts softly against his throat while Dick’s eyes get mysteriously shiny.

“I said I’m okay, and I *mean* it,” he argues soft and firm, “it’s time for me to go back and get to work.”

“There are *hundreds* of doctors--” Dick tries haltingly.

“I’m not having this argument,” Tim comes back, reluctant but decidedly pulling out of Jay’s mesmerizing hold. “Because there is nothing to argue about.”

He steps away, moves out of the bedroom because it is just *too easy* for them to convince him there. The t-shirt to go under the top is there, and he throws it on fast in an attempt to save himself from the very hot and pouty vigilantes following him. He’s struggling into the scrub top, pulling it down over his t-shirt (it’s about the computations behind unicorns. Yeah, *yeah*, it’s a great shirt), picks up his badge off the kitchen table to clip to the pocket, and has the vigilante only medical bag ready for things like *just incase*.

When he turns around, his boyfriends are blocking the way to the door, giving him *the look.* Tim keeps himself from sighing, but just *barely*.

“Sweetheart,” Jay starts out, seeming almost *hesitant* for a man that usually has no qualms tellin’ it how it *is*, “ya don’t got nothing ta prove ta us, you feel me?”

He tilts his head, blinking.

Dick picks up before he can deny anything, taking a step forward and reaching out a hand, “it’s fine to take as much time as you *need*, Timmy. We’re not...we’re not going to *judge* you, okay?”

So he inhales *slowly*, counts to ten.

Not helping.

He repeats the process.

“I *really* appreciate it,” he starts, “how much you care. *But*\--”

“But *nothing*,” Jay finally raises his voice a little, his arms getting *tight*, “you ain’t gotta *do* that shit, Tim. We do what we do ‘cause there ain’t nothing *else*, but that don’t mean jack-fuckin’-*squat* that cha gotta keep up with us!”

“That is *not* what this is about,” he snaps back, starting to feel anger curl up his spine. “This has *nothing* to do with Nightwing or the Red Hood or *any* of the night life!”

“The hell it *don’t*\--” Jay comes back heatedly, taking a step closer.

“This is about *my life*,” Tim interrupts viciously, “it’s about how *I* do what I have to do, and it’s no less *important* than the Red Hood or Nightwing or Batman or anyone else!”

He sees Jason gritting his back teeth, but they’re too far into it to stop now.

“Tim,” Dick is firm, resolute, “we push ourselves because if we *don’t*, then--”

“People *die*, Dick?” He comes back, turning to the older vigilante, “if Nightwing isn’t in Gotham, people might *die?* How is that *any* different than what I--”

“Because it’s *you*,” both of them yell back at him in an eerie kind of sync, startling him out of the snarling knot in his lower belly.

“God, *fuck*, Tim,” Jason yells at the ceiling, throwing up his goddamned *hands*, “don’tcha think we paid *enough* f’ karma ta just *stop* fuckin’ wid us? Well, we apparently *ain’t*.”

Dick’s hand on his shoulder makes Jay ease back, just a bit.

“Being with us is always going to mean you’re in danger, do you understand that, Tim?” And the torture is right there in Dick’s eyes, in the tight draw of muscle and fine tremble of his hand. “And one of these days, just like on that bridge, we’re going to be too far away. We won’t...we won’t be able to make it *in time*.”

Oh.

*Oh.*

And because he hadn’t *seen* this before, hadn’t realized *this* is why the two of them were so crazy about things, he blames shock for the obvious malfunction in his brain.

“If I wasn’t in love with you two, I’d seriously beat the *shit* out of you for underestimating me,” but his voice is hoarse with emotion. “And for the shitty double-standard. There have been times when *I* almost haven’t made it to either of *you* and if you think for one *second*\-”

But he stops because Dick and Jason are staring at him wide-eyed and slack-jawed.

Jay has a hand out, like he was reaching for Tim and just *froze*. Dick has a hand splayed over his chest, staring with his mouth hanging open.

And Tim blinks back whatever rigamarole he was going to come out with because--

*Oh God. He ****said**** it*.

The little epiphany he had while the world was crumbling under him, everything falling away, when he thought *this is the end, and I didn’t even get to tell them good-bye*.

It’s like one of those Hallmark movies where realizing how much you love someone is finally so crystal *clear* it’s amazing how you ever could have *missed it*.

And he just *threw it out there* like a complete dumbass without even thinking because Dick and Jay probably didn’t *feel* that way, couldn’t right? There was no way they could be as invested, and he’d probably made them extremely uncomfortable, maybe even enough that they--

*Please don’t be gone by the time I get back*. *Please don’t pack up your things and try to let me down easy. Please, please be able to pass that off as a fluke.*

“I’m sorry I said that,” he rushes before they can come out of shock, “I shouldn’t have. Put that on you two, I mean. Forget I said it and let’s just keep being us. How we’re-we’re *comfortable*. I shouldn’t haven’t… That was wrong of me, but a-anyway,” he keeps on talking, literally pushing between the two of them, able to move them easily, carefully not thinking about how the fight has just suddenly gone out of them. “It’s...it’s what our lives are. So...so, I’m not going to let it hold me *back*,” and *God*, his throat feels scratchy and his tongue too thick, stuttering out. His hands are minutely shaking by the time he manages to get the front door open, ready to just *run*.

“I’m...I’m going to work and do what I do. Tonight, you guys do the same, and we’ll...we’ll have dinner and everything is going to be *fine*, okay? It’s-it’s fine. It’s all going to be fine.”

And he can’t even look at them when he darts out, closing the door tightly behind him.

\*\*

The *welcome backs* are nice. The hustle and bustle is business-as-usual familiar and just enough to keep his brain busy so he doesn’t have to think too hard about other *things* (like Dick and Jay having a conversation after he left, about them thinking maybe they should pull back a little, give him some *space* to get a handle on his apparent *feelings*. God, what if they’re moving their stuff back to Dick’s apartment right now? *Don’t think about it, don’t think about it, don’t think about it*).

His leg starts aching up halfway through the shift and he manages to duck into one of the supply closets to massage the muscle out for a few minutes before he goes back on the floor for the next round of patients coming into his ER.

The second time a hard shock of pain shoot up into his hip and makes the leg almost give out on him. The Chief of Staff is very *not happy* about it.

“I can’t *believe* you,” Lucas Trent shoves him down in a chair while the healing muscle twitches and spasms, kneeling down to shove Tim’s scrub pant leg up and look at the injury. “Anyone else and you would have thrown them the hell out the second they came through the door. Seriously Tim, you had another *week*.”

“I was bored,” he grits out as those hands massage out the painful cramp. “I needed to come back to work.”

Luke looks back up at him with a frown, “the muscle is still traumatised, Tim. It’s not healed enough for you to take the longer shifts. I’m giving you straight eights for a while, so you’re out of here immediately. I’m calling you a cab, you’re going home, and taking care of this leg as soon as possible. Understand?”

Tim closes his eyes a little, shudders when he thinks about going *home*. “Yeah, yeah, okay.”

Trent stands back up and lays a hand on his shoulder, “Tim are you okay?”

“It hurts a little,” he comes back too quickly, not looking up. He busies himself by rubbing the leg out a little more and pulling his pant leg back down.

The Chief of Staff huffs out a sigh since he really *likes* Drake, but the guy can be a pain-in-the-ass. While Tim’s head is bent, a flash of something makes Luke look up quickly, catching a flash of white in the window. His eyes narrow at the flash of black and blue, but he schools his expression into neutral lines while Drake stands up and gives him a half-hearted, watered-down version of his usual grin.

“Thanks, Luke. I’ll take the shifts, try not to kill myself.”

“Everyone would appreciate that, Tim. Now go *home!* Don’t make me call in Stephanie and Layla or you’ll be in *real* trouble.”

The effect is immediate, Tim’s hands coming up in a *no, no, anything but ****that***. “No need for that. Like, at *all*, I’m going. See? This is me leaving.”

Nodding in approval, the Chief of Staff’s eyes slide back to the empty window, thoughtful on why one of Gotham’s premiere vigilantes would be outside his hospital at this time of night when it should be close to time for all Bats to turn in for the day. He hums to himself on the way back to his office, wondering if one of his best people might be of *interest*.

As Luke Trent heads back to the mounds of paperwork sitting on his desk, Tim half-limps into the break room to pull his bag out of his locker. He’s got one earbud in while he waves to everyone and takes a few minutes to update the replacement attending about the night’s activities. He’s numb by the time he gets outside in the crisp air, shivering automatically in his oversized hoody, listening to Imagine Dragons in one ear while the other keeps him from getting snatched into crazy vans (*again*). The burn in his calf is a secondary *owfuck* while he takes familiar back alleys and passes by the all-night bakery six blocks from his penthouse.

He gets about two blocks away, just has to make a left and he’ll be home in a few minutes, when his heart gives a hard thump in his chest and his feet won’t carry him any farther. The horrible indecision lingers in his brain pan, the possibilities, the *what-ifs* he’s tried not to focus on hitting him right where he’s about to make that damn turn and potentially unlock the door to see the familiar sights, Dick’s uniform shirt laid out over a chair, Jason’s holsters beside the couch, the mountain of DVDs, the clothes in his closet that are perpetually too big, the Superman and Wonder Woman toothbrushes on his sink, all of it--

*Gone*.

Instead of taking the left, Tim lets himself fall back against the brick and mortar of the old Soda Pop stand long out of business, lets his hands splay over the coarse brick, abrading his fingertips as he tries to pull himself *out* of the quaking fear and nausea low in his belly. But really, it’s his own *fault* anyway.

He’d gone into this relationship with Dick and Jay knowing they could never commit to anything long-term, not with the lives they lead, the duties that lay heavily on the two of them. He’d always *know* this thing they had was living on borrowed *time*.

It was okay because he *understood* that’s how it had to be, how *they* had to be. There could be no promises or *I love yous* because their lives didn’t allow for that (or because the two of them weren’t *there*. They cared, yes, they were with him as much as they could be, but to love him? That...that’s asking so *much* when Gotham, the *world*, already takes so much of them every fucking *night*). Saying it out loud was just a selfish thing on his part, a stupid, selfish mistake.

A mistake that might have costed him the best thing he’s ever *found*.

So when his eyes get hot, it makes Tim even angrier at his own selfish feelings because really he did this to *himself*.

With a hand out for balance, he limps back to the narrow alleyway between the two dilapidated buildings and lets himself sink down to the dirty ground, his other hand slapped over his mouth *tight*. Deep breaths through his nose, the twitching, twinging muscle in his leg radiating thumping pain in tune to his heartbeat, his chest shuddering when he attempts to just get himself under control again, to steel himself for whatever he might have to go home to face.

(But he could just keep walking straight instead, keep walking until he gets to Ives’ or Steph’s, to be there instead of the crazily empty apartment where the memory of being sat on the counter by big hands, of being sandwiched between two warm bodies on the couch, of stitching up broken skin and wrapping painful muscle damage, of throwing popcorn at the TV screen, and holding on tight enough to make his arms *ache* when memories were inescapable.)

Instead of standing up, he stays there, head in his hands, and lets himself shake apart for a few long and painful minutes.

The soft sigh in the night, the boots on concrete are lost in his silent self-recriminations, in berating he gives himself in the deep parts of his brain where he still can’t believe these two ever even considered someone like *him* worth their time.

(And he fucking *ruined it* all, didn’t he?)

“Hey, hey, it’s okay, it’s *okay*. I’m here.”

He jerks before Nightwing ever touches him, lurching to the side, gasping in a breath with his eyes still spilling over.

Staring up into the whiteouts is just another *fucking dammit* he really doesn’t *need*.

“What--” he tries hoarsely, quickly looking away to scrub at his face, “why aren’t you on patrol?”

The hands on him, the fingerstripes against his wrist, all so familiar and soothing, torturing him without the *intent*.

“I stopped by the hospital to check on you,” N admits without a hitch, “I was worried you’d push too hard. You...you always give everything you have no matter what. Timmy, Jay and I--”

“Don’t,” he moves away, out of those hands, manages to get his feet under him, “it’s--I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything. If you’re-if you’re *leaving*, I...I *get it*. I get it, and it’s fine.”

But his eyes are filling up again because no matter what his mouth might say, it still so fucking *painful* he feels like his chest is going to close up, going to keep him from getting any *air*.

“Wait, what?” N follows him, hearing the disgruntled noise over the comm in his ear. “*What?* Tim, what are you talking about?”

But the doctor is moving toward the mouth of the alley, retreating from this terrible conversation, wondering if he shouldn’t just go right the hell to Ives and stay for a few days.

*“Don’t like this, Dickie,” *Hood sounds just as disturbed as N feels, *“somethin’ ain’t right here.”*

With one finger, N taps the comm, “you’re not seeing what I’m seeing. Rendezvous at the nest. ASAP.”

He gets an arm around Tim’s waist before his civilian boyfriend can make good on an escape, already firing a grapple to get them airborne before Tim can try to kick out of his hold.

“Put me down,” is rough, harsh even with the wind whipping back and forth, “I can walk just fine, and Gotham needs you--”

“*You* need me more right now.” Nightwing replies darkly against his ear. “Stop arguing and hold on.”

And because it’s *easier*, he actually does, winds an arm around Nightwing’s neck, keeping his face firmly over a broad shoulder so he doesn’t have to look at those whiteouts, so the part that’s apparently coming (*“It ain’t that we don’t like ya, Timmers, ain’t that at all--” “It might be best if we take a...a break, okay? Give us all some time to think.” “It ain’t chu, Tim, it’s us, you feel me?”*).

All he has to do is keep his calm, to let them say their piece, and...keep himself together when he has to--

(*when he has to let them ****go***)

\--let them leave.

Once Nightwing lands it on the roof of his perch, Tim pulls out of the vigilante’s hold and limps his hurt ass right to the fire escape, muscles tight with the struggle to keep his shit together. It’s fine, he reminds himself, nothing lasts *forever*.

He doesn’t fall through the window, but it isn’t for lack of *trying*.

His leg feels like a burning point of pain shooting lightening up to his hip when he crosses the living room, pulling the scrub top off, laying his vigilante-only bag down. He doesn’t go for coffee or food, doesn’t look up at whatever message might be left on the fridge from the day while he was gone, doesn’t look too closely at *anything* in case things are already missing.

Instead, he pulls out a chair from his table and sits his weary ass down, throwing his hurt leg up on the chair beside him, turning to it, hunching over himself to look at the spot where he’d taken the stitches out himself the day before yesterday.

A mug is softly set by him on the table by a gloved hand, but he thumbs a trickle of blood away from his calf and tries resolutely to ignore the very *nice* gesture.

(*Because he ****knows**** what’s coming. Everyone leaves him, even Steph did for a while.*)

“I’m home, you can go back to patrol,” he tries a little desperately, jaw tight enough that the muscles twitches.

“Slow night,” Nightwing’s voice changes, becomes *Dick* as the domino comes off. He pulls out the other chair by Tim’s legs, deactivates the gauntlets, pulls them off with the gloves. “I’ve got nowhere else to be, baby, but right here with you.” Bare hand on his ankle, thumb moving over the bone.

Tim opens his mouth, almost blurts out, “for how *long* though? Can’t we just go back to where we were *yesterday?”* but closes his mouth so fast his teeth clack together.

The hand on his ankle tightens.

Tim busies himself with wrapping gauze around his calf, eyes focused on what he’s doing, refuses to look up at Dick’s face, Dick’s electric blue eyes, Dick’s *I’m so sorry* expression. So that’s the situation when the Red Hood hits the window, steps in still fresh from patrol with the scent of gunpowder and brimstone following him like cologne.

“Notcha best idea, yeah Tim?” The vigilante is already stalking across the room, gloved hands working by his sides.

If anything, his baby boy’s shoulders curve further down into himself, and Hood pulls off the helmet, puts it right on the table as he passes by. He looks up at Dick’s worried expression, a silent exchange back and forth since years of being partners have given them every ability to speak volumes without the need to say a single *word.*

When Dick’s frown deepens, when his brows draw together, Hood gets that all ain’t right in the world.

He pulls at the dom, gives it a toss, and bend down over their doctor. He doesn’t give a fuck what else is doing, winds still gloved fingers in too-long hair and *pulls*.

Tim’s head goes with the unexpected move, his eyes wide when his throat is exposed at the odd angle of the hold. He is *completely* unprepared for the mouth slanting down across his, for the lingering, familiar taste of cigarettes and chewing gum when a tongue is pushed into his mouth, slides over his in one *hell* of a *hiya baby, how’s kicks?*

Jay gives himself a few minutes to *enjoy* it. Sucks a little on Timmy’s lower lip, maps out that mouth until he gets a small noise, one that makes him all *kinds* of satisfied.

When he pulls back, Tim’s eyes flutter open wetly, and just the *sight* makes Jay straighten with a little dread rolling through his abdomen.

“Aw *shit*, s’at bad, ain’t it, Sweets?” His gaze goes to the leg Tim’s got propped up on a chair, notes the few splotches of blood on pristine bandages.

“It kind of...hurts. The Chief sent me home,” admitting it doesn’t make him feel bad because, you know, pending truth bombs and such.

“Coulda called,” Jay points out, picks up the mug and puts it in his palm.

Dick follows up, sliding his chair closer so both hands can take over the bandage job.

He sips his coffee since it’s in his hands and gives him a convenient excuse to do *something* in the ruminating *awkward*.

Still, it doesn’t take much to roll his eyes up and smirk, “nah. Figured you were busy beating the shit out of the Penguin for his bad life choices. Who wants to break up *that*?”

It’s enough for Jay to bark out an abrupt laugh, but the follow-up is the younger vigilante leaning down for more, being easy to make it nice n’ *sweet*.

(Timmy can have certain...*tendencies*. Running from things that could physically hurt him? *Naw*. Some things vaguely emotion-shaped? The whole story gets left out, makes you have to read between the *lines*.)

He keeps up with some slow, drugged kissing until Tim sighs against his mouth and his shoulders ease *down*. It might be a terrible thing that he keeps their boy distracted so Dick can lift his leg carefully in both hands and slither over the seat, hold the injured leg over his thigh the two of them closing in.

When he finally leans up, gives Timmy a little *space*, Dick is right there to supplement, nosing behind Tim’s ear before coming back for his *turn*. And it’s just like *Dick* to want to give *proof* with his body, to want to be close and hold on, to have one hand on his jaw, the other gripping his thigh while he drags his mouth over Tim’s until he sneaks inside.

(Apparently they had some things to *prove* here, Timmy.)

“That’s better,” Dick finally sighs against his mouth and sits back to rub circles in his calf knowledgeably (well, *acrobat* that is experienced with muscle strains and such).

Tim very pointedly brings up his coffee to hide how stupidly he’s *smiling* because *ugh, boyfriends* (yeah, yeah, so sometimes he’s a dumbass, but *honestly*, they’re going to be *nice* about it is all, so at least they aren’t going to just up and *go*. That...that’s *fine*, he can handle that).

“So, good night? You know, before you might have had to rescue a totally metaphorical damsel in *distress*?” He sits back too, easing down from the gnawing, yawning pit of fear that they (that *everyone*) would just--

*Disappear*.

(Trust him to get the most stubborn, and *capable* significant others pretty much on *Earth*.)

Jay hums and goes to the coffee pot with a kiss to the top of his head while Dick continues to work, eyes half-mast and rubbing those soothing little circles rhythmically.

“A few purse snatchers. Maybe a bank robbery if Demon wasn’t such a kiss ass,” Jay’s *World’s Best Zombie* mug is just the right look.

“Stop calling him *Demon Spawn* and he might be nice enough to let you in on it next time,” Dick points out serenely, “he’s a good kid once you get to know him.”

“Unfortunately, avoiding sharp, pointy things to the face is the first steps,” Tim volunteers.

He gets a hum and a laugh, watching Jay pull a chair out and flip it around effortlessly so he and Dick are facing him.

*Shit. Here it comes. The let-down*.

Jay takes a sip from his mug, but those eyes never leave him, the green flecks barely visible, and Dick sobers, the little circles moving up to his knee.

“About...about ah, *earlier*\--” he scratches the back of his neck while his face gets hot, damn his pale skin.

“I want to hear it again,” Dick interrupts softly, “that. That wasn’t really *fair*, Timmy. So, you have to say it for us again.”

And if he breathes in too fast, that must be why his chest is suddenly achy and his heart picks up just a little faster.

“Yeah,” Jay echoes, “yeah, Dickie, I feel that. I think maybe ya *owe* us that much, Baby Bird.”

He swallows a little, mouth suddenly dry, and looks from one to the other, “I’m in love with you two. It’s...it’s not *new*, but yeah. Without the masks, without the gadgets and the world-saving, that- that wouldn’t *change*. Robin, not Robin, vigilantes or the guys that lay with me on the couch and Netflix, either way, that’s going to be my answer.”

He blinks abruptly, realizing how fucking *stupid *that must sound, straightens up and works his hands around his mug.

“It’s...I don’t *expect *anything back, okay? I mean, that’s not why I...I shouldn’t have just dropped it like that, so I mean, things aren’t going to *change* or-or--it’s...You two were together before, you know, *this*, so if that’s how it *is*, I’m okay with--”

But the hand floats into his peripheral and takes the mug out of his hands. Stupidly, he watches it happen, head moving with the motion to put it on the table. Dick is already standing, grips his biceps to pull him up on his feet, compensating for Tim’s hurt leg, and sit his butt down on the table top. With his thighs spread to accommodate Dick’s hips wrapped up in Nightwing, his face is tilted up with those hands so thumbs can move over his jaw.

“I’m completely, crazily in love with you,” and Dick’s eyes are so fucking *blue*, darkening with the easily given admission. “The minute I woke up on your couch with my injuries taken care of and you asleep on the *floor*, I knew I was in trouble. It was...it was so *hard* on me to stay away in those early days, Tim, but I tried for you. I’m not sorry that it brought us here. I’m sorry every time you get involved in our messes, when you have to patch us up and get angry about it. I’m sorry I can’t promise for one hundred *percent* I’m always going to come home to you. But I *can* promise that while I’m still breathing, I’m always going to come *back*. You’re *mine*, Tim. For as long as you’ll have me, you’re *mine*.”

“Dick…” and dammit, now his eyes are all hot and full again, his voice cracking slightly.

The slow and soft move of their mouths together is that promise burned into his skin, and he’s helpless to do anything other than grip Dick’s wrists and open for his ownership.

An arm sneaks around his waist and he’s held closer, right up against the Kevlar and Nomac weave, his eyes fluttering shut when the kiss deepens and he can let Dick take over.

It never becomes too overwhelming, stays this perfect intensity.

“I’m sorry,” is breathed against his mouth, “I’m sorry I didn’t say so sooner.”

Whatever he might have said is groaned into Dick’s mouth.

It slacks off to just slow, drugged kisses and assurances in between, on how much Dick *needs* him, how much he makes their lives *better*, how he fills in this gap they never knew was *there*. And by the time Dick pulls back to rest their foreheads together and let his fingers ease the muscles in the back of Tim’s neck, the doctor’s mouth is red and wet, lips puffy and eyes soft with something utterly *fond*.

Those hands finally let him go so Dick can do that *thing* where his body is literally able to move in any direction at any moment, and slide across the table to bracket him from behind. He gets Jay next, fingers in his hair and the familiar smirk softer than the usual.

“Ain’t all that good with *words*, Sweets,” and he might breathe out a little harder at the low, syrupy quality of Jason’s baritone sliding across his spine like fingers, “but what I *know* ‘s real simple. Real easy ta *understand*.”

The hand tightens a little in his hair, holding him still so he can get the full view of Jay’s eyes, “me n’ Dickie ain’t right wi’out cha. It ain’t me n’ him, it’s *us*, baby, you feel me? There ain’t no *Dick ‘n Jay* without Timmy. There ain’t no baddie out there hard enough, mean enough, fucked-up enough ta keep me from comin’ back here ta ya. Not yet. Someday, maybe. Some day, when it’s my goddamned *time*, and they put me back ina ground, at least I’m gonna be able ta say…” Jay pauses, staring hard, throat bobbing as he swallows, “I’ma gonna be able ta say I fucking loved this little pain in my left nut more n’ anything. That he made alla hard fights n’ long nights worth every goddamned *second*. Little shit what don’t know how ta *run*, gotta keep tryin’ ta fucking *save* me.”

And the volumes behind it, behind Jason’s weary eyes, when the old pain and hurts, when the fears and indecisions, when the *Pit* and its’ temptations rise out of his soul to devour all the things he fights to *keep*, when the world should just move the fuck *on* and leave him where he belongs, it’s all there, laid open, bare to the *world*.

Tim Drake is one of the *few* that’s ever been able to see it.

So it’s *him*, that grips and pulls, that brings Jason closer, wraps his arms around the body suit, uses his leverage to pull so breath on his throat is heavy and wet-sounding, so the warm on his jugular sliding down is just that much evidence on what spectacular dumb assery it is to even *think* they might just--

Leave.

“Took too long ta figure it out, baby” is so soft he could almost imagine it’s not even there in his *skin*. “Never gonna give up on me, are ya?”

The laugh bubbles up, spills out of his mouth, cracks just around the edges, “no, you asshole, I’m not.”

“Must be martyrs, you n’ Dick then, yeah?”

Arms wrap around him from behind, Dick sliding a little closer to bracket his body between powerful thighs while Jay finally tilts him back enough to make the kiss just as easy as before, barely any pressure, an invitation that will never be a *no*.

And it’s crazy how Jason is laughing in his mouth while Dick’s arms tighten slightly and his forehead is pressed into the base of Tim’s neck, how the doctor gets sandwiched between them with the lines of their bodies fitting in this perfectly unperfect kind of puzzle, making a whole picture without the need to slide to the side to make it the right fit.

They’re going to keep him there and trade lazy kisses and easy touches, talking into skin and against lips, laughing and bantering, wallowing in something very comfortably *warm*.

His leg is eventually unwrapped, held in gentle hands, gets photographed and sent to Alfred because, you know, *Bats*, rewrapped while something delicious cooks and fills the kitchen with the usual smells of home.

It’s just one of those things when he gets carried to the couch (*damn, back to this again?*) and they lay all over each other while *Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow* runs as white noise.

The chemistry probably changes a few minutes in and a hand might sneak down below the waist to start a little something *nice*.

It progresses to hands running up sides, taking away covering so scars can be traced and sensitive skin brought to life with palms and mouths.

The eventuality is *so good, not enough, more,* and* not yet*. It’s how he could possible let this, any of this, any of *them,* go. It’s the fight to keep them up and moving whenever he can, to be the eye of the storm when the lives they lead come crumbling down but he can still do some*thing* even if it is just *holding on*. And while his body is brought to the peak, when he can’t *think* in full sentences, when he’s crying out and arching up or back or down because there has to be *more*, then he can say it without a moment of hesitation.

He can *scream *it when he explodes and whisper it hoarsely while they’re coming down.

He can say it because he just *has to*, because they need to hear it as much as he needs to say it.

He whimper it against skin with his eyes wet.

He can say it because he *means *it.

“I love you...fuck, I *love* you.”
