## Running Out of Time II

Since it all boils down to *time*…

The Architect pushes, pushes, *pushes*. It’s all-encompassing, the pressure around her, the weight of time and space on her shoulders. The gauntlet burns, but they’re so close to the final goal.

# *Now*

Jim Gordon is desperate for a cigarette.

One hand shoved in the pocket of his trench coat fiddles with the pen he keeps in there, an old twitch from when he kicked the habit almost years ago.

Barbara got him a certificate on the anniversary to celebrate.

His people are milling in and out of the run-down shack located in the Bowery, and Jim listens with half an ear to the radio as his other patrols report back about finding their apparently kidnapped detective, mostly unharmed thanks to some of the Bat vigilantes, and is en route back to GCPD to give a statement.

He’s glad to know Grayson is only a little banged up after being taken hostage during a routine prisoner move, and orders Inigo to be put in an interrogation room back at the station– he intends to get every damn thing out of him before the night is done because if there’s anything Jim Gordon goes after without prejudice–

It’s dirty cops.

When the four suspects are finally brought out of the shack in handcuffs and leg restraints, Jim gives them the hairy eyeball of someone that’s seen a lot of shit in his time on the force, but his patented glare doesn’t make even one of them *flinch*.

*Arrogant jackasses*, he thinks, fiddling with the pen again, *I must be getting too old for this shit. *

But one of the perpetrators chances a glance back at Gordon, smirking smugly, making the Commission immediately suspicious they might be planning another jailbreak–

But the suspect’s eyes go out into the darkness over Jim’s shoulder, and his expression falls, fear flashing long enough to be *obvious*.

Oh yeah, the Commissioner has seen *that* look before.

He waits until the perps are loaded up and toted off, three squad cars following them just in case there could be more following the transport van. It’s his turn to smirks as he takes a small step back into the shadows without turning away from the crumbling shack.

“Hell of a good night, even for you.” He starts casually and chances a look over his shoulder, expecting to see only an outline of the pointy ears and lower half of a face.

But nothing is in the shadows behind him.

*What the–?*

Because his instincts about a certain Caped Crusader are hardly *ever* wrong after all these years, Jim’s eyes dart down just a *smidge*–

And there’s a set of whiteout lenses.

He doesn’t jump, but it takes some *effort*.

After his time dealing with the Bat’s damn *sidekicks* (even after they all grew up), you would think he’d be used to short little shits by now. Just goes to show, old dogs and new tricks.

“Commissioner Gordon,” Robin’s voice is pitched low, the cape and hood half in shadows (and Jim has been around the vigilantes long enough to know when one of them is *amused* and trying to hide it– you might be the Boy Wonder, kid, but you’re not old enough to put one over on him).

Gordon gives a put-upon sigh. Batman isn’t the *only* detective in Gotham now is he?

“Hm. Finally ran over the big guy with the Batmobile, huh?” Gordon chuffs as he takes a few small, subtle steps backwards without looking away from his people on the scene.

“*Tt*, he is more resilient than even *I* give him credit for, and I am his partner.” Robin replies with the barest of noises, the shift in shadows.

Jim Gordon chokes on an abrupt laugh and fiddles with the pen. “All right, kid. Since he left you to mop up, tell me what you’ve got on Shaw and these other mugs. Not to mention my dirty cop. I’m sure you’ve already got a book on where he went wrong.”

By the time Robin lays it out for the Police Commissioner, Gordon had inched back enough to be standing almost in shadows, not quite shoulder-to-shoulder but not far from it either.

He drops a hand for Robin to slide in a file folder.

Discreetly, Jim glances at Bullock, too busy kneeling down by the remains of glass by a broken window (*Perp 1 found on the concrete outside, cuts and abrasions, muttering about ‘bat, bat, bat!’*). He manhandles some of the glass in a small evidence envelope absently.

*No one’s really looking hard for evidence. The Bats are really making my people lazy. Mental note, talk to Barbara again. They’ll listen to her.*

“The DA had a solid case against Shaw last year, kid. He confessed. Now, you’re going to tell me you’ve got indisputable evidence he was being blackmailed all this time? Even while he was in Blackgate?”

“Yes,” the younger half of the Dynamic Duo taps a finger on the Commissioner’s elbow, and Gordon drops his hand down to his side again without looking away from the case file. Something slim is pressed into his palm, *ah*, even the damn flash drives have the Bat logo.

Really, trust the Dark Knight to be *that* OCD*.*

“You will find communications to exonerate Shaw decoded here. You will also find evidence to convict his kidnappers. All you will need is video footage from their recent ‘visits’ to him in prison.”

Gordon sighs as Harvey Bullock nudges a uniform, making a *drinky-drink* motion. “Sometimes you need to let the police do the leg work, kid. My guys are getting *lazy*, so tell the big guy I’d appreciate if he–”

Gordon glances over his shoulder to find Robin

*Gone*.

It’s a heavy sigh for the Commissioner before he steps back into the crime scene, “all right! Bullock, get the evidence back to the station and stay put in that lab until we’ve got positive matches. I want to know *who* these guys are and who they work for. Sit on ‘em until they talk. Montoya, we’ve got some communiques. Get it to IT. I want to know where it came from, who else might have been involved. *All* of it. Benedict, get the family to a safe house and for the love of God*,* make sure it’s secure.”

At the sound of Gordon’s voice, uniforms and detectives *scatter*.

*Well,* he thinks, *maybe I’ve still got it after all*.

\*\*

The massive shadow slides to a stop and the top rolls back smoothly, easily. A blur of red, green, and grey leaps inside before the hatch retracts and the tires spin for less than a breath before they catch and the big car shoots off into the night.

B shifts the big car smoothly, Robin riding shotgun after hiding the Ducati outside another safehouse not far from the scene of their latest take-down.

He feels somewhat better knowing the Shaw family is probably already being shuffling into Witness Protection and GCPD working angles on the would-be extortionists. They’d be more careful after knowing one of their own was in on the game. Of course, the Batman planted trackers and cameras on the small, reunited family, had contacted the Birds of Prey to keep up with them – just to make sure they would be safe from Red Robin’s shadowy organization bent on using WE technology for criminal activity.

If it comes down to it, the Gotham PD could hold their own against a handful of international terrorists, and that is where B needs the thugs until he could put on his *good vigilante/bad vigilante* reinforced gauntlets and have a very thorough round of ‘question the criminal.’

Of course, he has the utmost faith in Gordon and his people, but there are too many factors outside of Gotham the GCPD aren’t privy to, and the Bat needed to gather more evidence from all angles before he could get to the kidnappers (but there *would *be time eventually). For now, they could take in the hospitality at Blackgate.

In the back of the big car is the laptop he’d confiscated from the would-be assailants of Shaw. He would have Tim’s help to decrypt the hard drive so they could find out as much as possible about the new group of bad guys infiltrating his city.

Which is really what he doesn’t want to be dealing with tonight, if he’s being completely honest. Tim already has several flavors of criminals they need to get to, and B is hoping they won’t have to be divided too far to take all of them (of course, that’s what he has the League for, and *dammit*, he’s going to owe Diana and Clark a ‘date night’ in exchange for help, isn’t he? Well, being a billionaire does have its perks. He could probably take a night off after Tim’s cases are solved to wine and dine his *other* partners–)

Robin is talking beside him, brows furrowed and arms crossed over the tunic, “I simply do not believe him, Father. The corrupt officer claimed to be compliant to their plan because of the monetary compensation.”

“Look at the evidence,” the Batman replies, his usual growl turned down a notch, “Inigo has been on GCPD for the last year. He’s take low-profile homicides, easy cases, and decides out of blue he’s going to be on prisoner transport detail?”

Robin puts together what B is thinking. “Ah, thus Grayson joined the transport. Inigo has probably been one of them since the beginning. It’s a plan they’ve had someone in place in the inside since Shaw took the blame for their crimes.” Robin nods like he’d already come to the same conclusion. “Perhaps even waiting until the technology they require has been created.”

B just hums, “most of that is speculation, but I agree. Inigo could have been a plant to make sure Shaw is kept under control and keep what they’re doing in our city under-wraps. If Shaw ever tried to expose them, implicate anyone else in the crime, Inigo could get to him in Blackgate.”

“And silence him.”

“Exactly.”

“But, how did you know Inigo was one of them, Father?”

“All the thugs we took down had one thing in common. One thing Inigo also had.”

“A terrible odor?”

A side of the Batman’s mouth quirks in humor, but he *did* notice they all smelled like open water, just like workmen at Dixon Docks – something to make him all the more *suspicious* that Shaw’s jailbreak and Tim’s incoming crate are somehow *related*. Honestly, he’s not someone to believe in coincidences outside the realm of magic, multiverse travel, and time manipulation – even then, there’s usually something else behind it all.

(*The theory is starting to come together, what he’d already told O back in the Monte Carlo. He’s going to put it together long before Tim tries giving them the duck n’ dodge.*)

“That too. But, they all had a marking on their left hands, something that looked like a burn scar. One of them I could understand, but *all* of them? On the same spot between the thumb and index finger? Too much of a coincidence. Probably part of a larger organization. One way to recognize other members is by having that mark.”

(*The incoming shipment is connected to Meta-tech and the Insidious Seven, with other labs and organizations bent on making an army of powerful bad guys...bad guys that could be connected to those trying to get WE tech, Tim’s tech. *

*Just like the White Triad last year. The similarities could mean their organization is back up and running.*)

He feels more than sees Robin’s head turn out of his peripheral, “how did you notice this, Father? You were breaking furniture and protecting the family while I–”

“I’ve been in this business longer than you’ve been alive, Son. Have I mentioned ‘*I am the Night*’?”

“I may have been told this before; however, I am unable to believe it when *Brucie Wayne* gets caught in yet another skiing accident–”

“Sometimes, you have to take a real fall to be believable.”

“Tell that to your fractured femur, *Batman*.”

Even Robin is cracking a small grin, and B knows they’ve done good work tonight. (*The rest of the party is just getting started. We are going to have our work cut out for us, aren’t we, boys?*)

“I first noticed it when I was undercover, checking out the men holding N. Ten guards, clothing ill-fitting so probably stolen, and all of them had that mark. The one must have been a fairly new member. I noticed the scar tissue reflected in the light. It was the same triangle shape. It was easier during the fight since most people will punch head-on, so the marks were easy to see. Once we make it to GCPD tomorrow night before the shipment drops, he’ll be the most likely to give over the others.”

Robin makes his usual *tsk*. “Fortunately, we have several ways into the holding cells.”

“It’ll give us something to do while Red, N, and Hood go down to Dixon Docks for the *shipment* Red is hot after.”

“Agreed. I have a tendency to cause mischief when I am *bored*.”

“That’s not true,” B defends mildly, “you always cause mischief. I blame your brothers.”

“Father!”

“Tell me it’s not true.”

“...*tt*.”

“Mmhm.” The Batmobile turns easily into the next street, easing into the night. They’ve already gotten their wayward first Robin, taken down terrorists, found some leads in the cases their working, and gave the GCPD intel they could use.

Everything is looking good–

Until the sounds of sirens splits the calm.

They Dynamic Duo exchange a long look, and even if it’s not something *obvious* or said out loud, even if it’s something *new*, Father and Son don’t have to say a word to be in perfect agreement.

B gives the wheel a sharp turn and hits the street to take them to Midtown, stomping on the gas so the car lurches forward. Robin is leaning forward with a smirk of anticipation, reaching out to touch a button on the console, “Agent A. We are taking a detour. We shall return to the Cave once the present threat is assessed and detained.”

“Very good, Master Robin. Shall I have the usual brunch and bandages prepared for your return?”

“Just try and keep Nightwing, Red Hood, and Red Robin corralled,” B fills in, “I don’t want any of them slipping off on their own yet. We haven’t pooled all our resources.”

“Understood, Sir. I shall tempt the young Masters with honey. Should that prove ineffective, I shall use threats of your incessant *hovering*–”

A sky blue Camaro comes tearing through the intersection at Broadway and 9th, swerving at the last second to avoid taking out the Batmobile’s front end. The police cruisers are far enough behind that B can cut the wheel and take off.

“Duty calls. Use whatever *works*, Agent A. Batman and Robin out.”

# *Now: The Littles*

\*\*

Karmen is standing in one of the secondary control stations in the Watchtower, crouched down and concentrating on keeping herself camouflage, waiting for Charlie to finish bypassing the system so she can get into the JLA’s recent files and scans to see what they might be dealing with and why their superhero guardians scooped them up so abruptly.

(*At this juncture in their time in the world of superheroes, they all have come to recognize the signs of *trouble.*)*

The thing is, once they’ve moved out of *terrified* and waiting for it to all start over again, when enough trust was established for the kids to really *believe* they wouldn’t be sent away, they started to push the boundaries so they wouldn’t be left in the dark anymore.

(*But is that the truth? *Leo’s wondered more than once, *are they just trying to prepare for the next time someone wants them *gone* again?*)

Some of their superhero guardians haven’t made any attempt at hiding the truth from them (*Tim*) while others have argued the kids need the space to be permitted to be *kids* (*Ollie and Hal*), so restricting their access to general files, cold cases, and low-rated crime entries was pretty much a given. Caro has already told them calmly Vic knew about their hack attempts and allowed them access **only** to certain things (not even Charlie can circumvent Cyborg’s security features. Well, not *yet* anyway).

He didn’t let them have everything, but they’re still given the freedom to *look*. As they’ve come to find out, however, Vic always forgets about the residual recent files folder. Scans and cases the JLA are currently working are usually dumped there from certain repositories, and Tim’s lessons have *really* been paying off because they’re figuring out where the good intel hides.

*“He’s almost got it. Hold on for a few more seconds, Karm*.*”* And Leo’s voice sounds small and squeaky to Karmen, but Caro immediately gives her a reason why.

*“Leo’s in the hall keeping watch. He’s the cutest little mouse!”*

*“I’m not ****cute***,* Cuddles!”*

*“Nu-uh, even your *tail* is cute, Leo.”*

*“I have to agree*,” Charlie sounds amused and distracted, “*we should ask for another pet so you have someone to hangout with.”*

*“I can just change into a fish and swim around with Maris.”*

*“But we can only carry around a small bowl, you might squish her!”*

*“I would never squish her. I have better control than that.”*

*“Says the guy that changed back inside the wall.”*

*“THAT WAS ONE TIME, CHARLIE.”*

*“One is all it takes, Leo.”*

And the screen in front of Karmen displays the JLA logo for a brief moment, Charlie’s satisfaction reverberating through their shared link.

*“All right*, *let’s see what we can find,*” Karm sighs fondly in the connection, she straightens up with the system gives her what she needs to know. Data scanned from the Tower made it there, too.

She pulls up a flagged report on a gauntlet and looks over the analysis run under Cassie’s username. There’s information on the power output and the DNA altering capabilities. With the others softly urging her, she goes back to the recent files repository and looks for more information on this gauntlet. There’s a link to Red Robin’s main report she can’t access, something about bad guys, the Insidious Seven, but that’s all she can see.

Frustrated, her form flickers for the blink of an eye before she goes back to the initial scans from Titan’s Tower and reads more closely while Charlie tries to hit a few backdoors and redirects to dig out more information.

(*Why would something like this make the JLA panic enough to round them up? It doesn’t make ****sense**** yet.*)

When she scans the notes from Red Robin on the analysis–

The physical revolution is enough to get the other children’s immediate attention.

*“I-I think I found something.”* But her voice is weak and shaky.

The link goes quiet as all the four children digest the data in front of them, shocks of fear and surprise criss-crossing over the connection. Leo has to sink his claws into the carpet to keep himself from scurrying after her, his whole body reacting with two different stimuli: *run* and *protect.* Caro’s eyes well up with tears, her chest caught up in a stuttered breath. Charlie flinches, knees wobble just enough to be noticable, but he’s still able to save a copy of the analysis to his own back-up drive while his heart pounds dully, the noise rushing in his ears.Charlie doesn’t pull away when Caroline slides her hands into his and holds tighter to the Carl the Unicorn with her other arm. She squeezes Charlie’s hand once and then slides her arm around the back of his shoulders to pull his side up against hers, to give him the same kind of hug Mister Booster gives just about everyone.

It’s understandable they would all automatically reacted to the name *Genesis* in Red Robin’s notes.

Karmen, with grim determination, forces herself to read more, to inhale the data while trying to be neutral and not jump to conclusions.

She reads over Barry’s notes on the file, and B’s mention of Einstein’s Theory of Special Relativity, the effect of gravity on *time*. Somehow, the gauntlet can allow the wearer to almost manipulate–

*Time.*

Barry’s notes compare the gauntlet’s power with his own and the difference in manipulation, but the speedster writes he’s never met anyone that has the kind of control, so where that power came from, he couldn’t say. The obvious displays from the other gauntlets during the Titan’s last big fight show use of shapeshifting, skin augmentation, technomancy, super speed, super strength... but *this* is something altogether new.

The implications are heavy, weighing the young girl down where she stands. Her hands tremble, pause, her eyes getting heavy and hot when her mind’s eye connects *time* with the lost one from their group, the one Dr. Poehler took away and *never brought back*.

Karmen doesn’t think they were able to figure out how her power worked, how she could make time slow down just the tiniest bit when she was being hurt by their *tests*. But if the gauntlet could do something almost the same, then they must have–

(*They killed her trying to crack the secret of her power. They killed her because she never came back. She never came ****back****.*)

Her eyes spill over when the face in her mind smiles sweetly even with bruises and scrapes and needles in her arms, and the sob in her chest is so *hard* to control.

*Karm. Come back, Karmen. We can see you!*

*It’s okay. We all miss her, too. It’s okay to be sad*.

But it feels like she can’t even move with the sadness and pain creeping up her throat, choking her, making her gag like it’s one of their tests all over again–

*I’m coming to get you, just hold on*.

But Karmen can’t respond, is too lost in the horrible traumas in that laboratory. She’s buried so *deep* it’s like she can feel them peeling layers of skin off her arms again, like she can feel the bad stuff that *burned* her like fire to see what her power would do if her skin is damaged. She doesn’t even feel the mouse bumps its’ head against her foot because Karmen’s chest heaves in old panic, fear, and agony.

She doesn’t even flinch when Leo transforms back into a little boy, doesn’t even *see* him standing there. Instead, she’s lost in old horrors from those sterile rooms and corridors. She back on a table, strapped down while they scrape at her skin for *test* to take *samples*.

She doesn’t feel Leo lift her up with both arms and *run*. Doesn’t feel the tears streaming down her face or hear the soft, hurt whimpers she’s making. She sees masked adults looming over her, talking about her but never *to* her. She only sees the gurney next to her with their lost one, those sparkling green eyes dazed with drugs and pain, but the smile is still encouraging, the other little girl reaching out with her free arm, trying to give Karmen comfort when there was no other comfort to be found–

(*She was the oldest, the kindest, the one that held them in her lap when the pain was ****too much****, sang to them, tried her best to comfort them–*

*And she never came back. She never came ****back****.*)

–and Karmen never even got the chance to say *thank-you*.

\*\*

# *Red Robin and the Red Hood*

Clinging to the back of the Ducati while the world passes in a blur, Red Robin comes back to the situation at hand–

(*Sleuthing. A metric *fuck ton* of bad guys are probably going to be infiltrating*–or already have infiltrated–* Gotham in the next twenty-four hours looking to start-up a Meta Army. Well, we are coming up on a weekend.)*

–because things like “*Don’t. Run.”* are still sitting crazily in his brain pan.

He’s doing the usual kind of multitasking, working on his wrist computer while his thighs are bracketing the Red Hood’s, and he can feel the pressure of that ass even through the suit.

Luckily, he became accustomed to dealing with it in tights and jock. You know, so guys like the Joker won’t laugh at him sporting a semi because *that* wouldn’t ruin his bad ass reputation.

Not. At. All.

(*Stop. Thinking. About. It.* But the look on on Dick’s face, the way Jason took a step toward him with some fucking *intent*...*Wishful thinking, asshole. *It was because of bad guys and *Welcome Home* and since he finally, *finally* really called *out*.)

Perched on the back of Hood’s ride after a pretty rocking night with a little detecting going down, he’s monitoring Kon’s vitals via the sensors in the Tower while his cape flies behind him and the wind is tearing through his hair like he’s Robin again. The thought doesn’t make him cringe, doesn’t cause him the old kind of pains, and that?

Means life is getting *better*. It means *he’s* getting better, *they’re* getting better.

Take into account his best friend’s vitals are completely normal and no after-effects of wearing *bad guy tech* seem to be hitting, then they’re already ahead of the game.

(*Thank God they got to Dick before the White Triad got him out of Gotham.*)

Once he gets the Bats on the *evil bad guys trying to make/sell Metas* train and *away* from the terrorist asshats, then he can ease it down a notch. After everything is said and done, he might have time for a nice little revenge hunt.

First, he might have to work himself down from the edge he’s riding after the explosion he and Officer Grayson narrowly managed to escape. (*Don’t think about it*.) Going back to the Cave is going to mean his bullshit tech has to be *on fucking point* for everyone to follow the plan and not get themselves locked in to his mess. It’ll probably help that he can effectively pull the *owfuck* card since he’s still feeling the takedown of those damn Armenians, and these things are going to take some time to heal. Using it to his advantage will give him some leverage if they try to insist he stay in tomorrow night and *coordinate* efforts instead of step out on *his* shipment.

(*Here’s a whole lot of Nope for you.*)

Still, it wouldn’t hurt to play his injuries up if it gets him what he needs.

Speaking of which, B’s new suit is apparently made with such things in mind since he’s not sporting any new aches than he was before with healing shrapnel and bullet wounds. The body armor is actually doing a *righteous* job of keeping pressure in the right places so the muscle movement isn’t nearly as painful as it would be in his standard Gotham attire. He would need to have B lay out the composition for him sometime because he could really get used to a suit like this*,* thank-you very much.

A gloved hand reaches back to grip the side of his thigh while he’s scanning the analysis of the gauntlet’s half-ass coding, anchoring him to the bike as they tilt to the right when the curve is sharp and his own ride can’t be *too* much farther down the road.

And, you know, Hood normally does that, holds the leg of his passenger if the turn gets sharp. Roy, Dami, Dick, Cass, Steph, him, even B on the *Surprise, Batman!* occasions. It’s a *thing* he does with virtually *everyone*.

(*He’s not letting go.*)

It still makes Red’s already painfully alert senses go a *little* off-kilter while he’s trying to focus on *how* the gauntlet is able to rewrite genetic code.

(*Those eyes when the bathroom door opened.*)

Squashing all of it down, staying in *Red* mode is proving to be a struggle because *really*. The hand moves up just an inch more and he’s going to jump off the back of the bike and take his chances.

The woods get familiar under the cut of Hood’s headlamp, breaking his thoughts from this embarrassing *dilemma*.

He’s got Shaw and WE tech to keep B and Rob *all* kind of busy. Then a shipment of who fucking knows what to Gotham Harbor– care of his favorite ass hat terrorists who put real *feeling* into their torture practices. Add in the gauntlet and tracing the distributors, the owners, the buyers, not just the bad guys that used them. He’s pretty damn sure the technology came from a little place called *Genesis*, tying their kids in, and even though it had been months since then, it seems like research is still out there for anyone with a mad scientist complex wanting to try and play God.

*See “The Insidious Seven,” Ass-Napkins, for more details*.

All in all, his plate is full.

Once they’ve convened back at the Cave, everyone handed out assignments, it’ll be time to start some contingencies and get it the fuck together.

(*He’s got a score to settle*.)

In the back of his brain pan where the vigilante isn’t housed, the small voice slyly tells him fighting crime with the Batfamily is getting more familiar, is getting easier...and he doesn’t want to fight it anymore, doesn’t want to give it up. The trust that’s been building during the last few months has gone so far in repairing all those fractured parts enough that his plans are actually including Bats.

(*That other foot is back in Gotham again, and he can’t think of it as a bad thing.*)

In a blink, the familiar stretch of highway is *perfect timing*.

Red taps the back of the hand still on his leg, the universal sign for *hey, pull it over*.

Hood squeezes his thigh back and starts to coast, kicks with a booted heel to down-shift.

Red’s non-sleep deprived brain circles back around to the pending showdown(s) as he climbs off from behind Hood to scope out his own Ducati, looking fine after he took a leap off it to the speeding truck.

The taller vigilante automatically reaches out to grip his forearm to steady him since, you know, slightly injured and such.

And it’s completely *stupid* how his mouth drops open to almost *throw it out there* between them since this really isn’t the time, not when the Mission comes first.

*(I think Dick almost kissed me. I also think you were going to back in the Cave. What the shit is going on with you two? How could–? Why?!)*

Because it’s getting to a dangerous point, a place where one of them is going to step over some kind of imaginary *line*...and he’s...*concerned* it could cause a rift between all of them.

If it goes much further, he’s going to have to say something. He’s going to be the asshole that starts pulling back, shoving N and Hood in each other’s faces when he gets those expressions…* *aimed at his *face*.

Sure, it would be awkward for a while, but things would even out soon enough, and the three of them could go back to the usual witty banter and fighting crime level they’ve made it to in the last few months. Something he realizes he doesn’t want to *lose*.

So in the few seconds while he stands staring at his bike through the whiteouts, giving Hood his back as the Ducati engine purrs between them, he blurts it out before he changes his mind.

“After this is all done and over with, when we’ve got the baddies and our kids are safe, we... need to have a *talk*, Jay.”

The helmet moves in his direction, the whiteouts following his progress to his own bike because, well, *real names while in the mask* is one of their strictest *no-no* rules. And as much as he wants to swallow it down, not to push–

He *can’t*.

(Can't deflect, cant pass it *off*. Not with everything that’s happened in the last 24 hours in Gotham, in the Cave, in the Manor. These things might drive him out of his damn *mind*.)

“Yeah?” is soft even with the synths, the tone of voice is *off* somehow from the usual old Gotham drawl, “wanna have a *talk, *Timmy? Sounds like you got yourself something to *say*.”

Keeping his back to Hood’s whiteouts, Red pulls his Ducati up off the ground and throws down the kickstand.

“I think… yeah. Yeah, I think we need to talk.”

“S’alright then. Meet’cha back at the Cave and we’ll have a lil’ *talk*, Timmers–”

“It can wait until after all the sleuthing going down. Besides, I’m going back to my Perch, but we can Skype it out when I’ve got more intel and a *plan*–” and he’s *really* not a coward. *Nope*, but just the talk itself is going to be difficult. It’ll work a little easier if he’s at his nest while the Bats are coordinating in the Cave.

“Nuh-uh,” Hood waves a finger back-and-forth, when Red glances back over his shoulder, “I gotcha the damn *devices* those motherfuckers were talking about, and only one bird’s got the best low-down on tech. B’s gonna want ya right the fuck on it, you feel me?”

Which just *shows* how well Hood knows him because tech could give him more to go on, another spot of evidence in this very quickly widening gyre of bad guys and terrible things happening.

*Shit. He is figuratively ****boned***.

(Wouldn’t it be nice to be legitimately–?

*Enough with the awkward thoughts for ****fuck’s sake****.*)

“Then what I’ve got to say will wait until after we blow this case open,” he replies, pointedly going to his wrist computer just to look *busy*, giving him something to look at other than Hood. The distraction completely helps him pretend the one-sided *UST* isn’t even *there*.

“Mmhm. Maybe it will...n’ maybe it *won’t*,” and it sounds sounds softer coming through the synths, drawing Red’s gaze back to Hood’s loveable ass.

(*“You were ****my**** Robin.” *)

“We don’t need distractions,” he comes back, easing up a little to try and play *witty banter*, “we need someone to pick-up Dick’s stupid ass before he gets taken off the street again. Are you on that?”

He knows he’s in trouble, *knows* something about the jig being *up* when Hood kicks the stand down and leans the bike, throws a leg over, and crosses his arms over his chest. The whiteouts in the helmet are pointing right at him.

“Could be, Timmy. But if you n’ Dickie weren’t quite *done* with your conversation by the time I rolled up, you could go pick him up yourself.”

And Red Robin is a vigilante that stands up to megalomaniacle ass clowns on a regular, but this hits something in his chest, makes it coppery in the back of his mouth.

“We just got blown up a little,” and *no no*, he’s already turned back to his bike so there’s no *way* Jason can see how hot his face is without some kind of X-ray vision.

(*Thank ****fuck***)

The noise coming from Hood is something all too *knowing*, making his stomach drop just a little.

“Wouldn’ta thought that was the *sitch* when I rode to the rescue*,* Baby Bird. Seemed t’me like the two of ya were nice and *comfy*. Awful *close* after almost bein’ blown ta bits.”

And just like that, the *knowing* smarm to Hood’s tone makes Red Robin’s hands tighten down on the Ducati’s handlebars.

“High velocity explosions are *really* conversation-worthy, Hood–” because he’s fucking *Red*, isn’t he, the master of misdirection and *dammit* if he won’t earn the title “–not to mention things like *wow, I’m really glad you aren’t horribly maimed for life. *Did I mention he was in *plain clothes*, Hood?”

The noise through the synths, a choked laugh, eases out of this realm of *uncomfortable*. But when Hood reaches out to grip his elbow, to step just a little too *close*, Red Robin feels his neck creak when he cranes up to look.

“Timmy,” is softer than he would have liked considering they’re in the middle of the woods with everyone on the team fighting to get evidence for a *massive* case. The thumb on his elbow makes circles he can barely feel through the suit between the armor plating.

He blinks up from behind the mask, brows furrowed, “Jay?”

The silent moment when he thinks he can feel Jason Todd staring at him, wonders what thoughts are going through his head.

“Be careful,” after a long, *long* moment of the thumb rubbing soothing circles, “I’ma pick up Dickie so’s ya can go play with yer tech. B’s gonna need some answers, you feel me?”

“...okay,” and something, *something*, sparks, makes his chest a little tight, makes him lean in without really realizing it. “I’ll see you two at the Cave.”

“Mmhm, won’t take long.” And he might imagine it, that the helmet dips lower, putting them closer…

“O to Bats,” both comms go off at the same time, and Red might be imagining it, but he thinks he hears a rough sigh through the synths. “I need all the good little vigilantes to check in. We’ve got some heavy numbers to crunch and a whole lot of tech to analyze. I also need access to the Tower’s files on the gauntlet, Red. We have some cross-references to talk about.”

“No rest for the weary,” Red smirks up, leaning the bike up so he can lean away, taps his comm to talk to O. “I’m on my way. Hood is going to give N a ride back to HQ.”

“Then get a move on, boys, everyone’s on the clock.”

“Understood. Bats out,” he says just as the hold is gone from his elbow and Hood is backing up to his own bike, throwing a leg over.

(And it’s crazy how something in him, something unexplainable is oddly...*disappointed*.)

He covers his ass by throwing his weight down to start the bike, looks back at one of his partners, “don’t let N get lost.”

“Could say the same thing ‘bout you, Red.”

“Yeah, yeah. Tech and shit, remember?” But the banter feels off, too desperate, making him more antsy to get back and bury his head in the evidence.

There is a noise, could be a guffaw or a snort, and Hood walks his Ducati next to Red’s, leans over just a little, puts their whiteouts *close*.

“Ain’t alone anymore, Timmy. Dunno how far we gotta *go* so’s ya *geddit*, but if’n a conversation is whatcha need, me n’ Dickie can do that.”

Even though he can’t see through the helmet’s whiteouts, he sees Jay’s eyes get...*dark* in his mind’s eyes, imagines the green flecks are more pronounced, and an unconscious shudder works up his spine, hands tightening down on the handlebars again.

“I’ll...keep that in mind. But seriously, *baddies* to take down Jay. Then-then we talk, okay?”

Hood reaches over, lays his gloved hand over Red’s, squeezes, hangs on a few seconds longer than necessary–

(*but it’s fine. They’ve both been more handsy the last two months or so, just *totally* normal and he needs to *stop* reading too deep into every fucking move, or risk making himself literally *insane.)

“Here whenever ya need us. Don’t gotta be shy ‘bout it...not now that you, me, n’ Dickie are in a good place, yeah?”

To keep from looking flustered, to divert his attention away from the tightening low in his abdomen when the thumbs rubs absently over his knuckles, Red Robin purposely chuffs a laugh. “Take into account I have *so much* *cereal* you can mooch, Hood. Lucky Charms *and* CoCo Puffs. But...yeah, I know, okay? We’re...we’re good now. Vigilante besties, right?”

“Maybe somthin’ like that,” and the feel of leather sliding off the back of his hand should be impossible to feel through his gloves, but Red swears Hood is doing it with enough pressure to make sure he *knows*.

“Right,” is more breathless than he’d like, his brain pan flickering with a whole lot of *WARNINGWARNINGWARNING.* “After all our bad guys are safely put away in their prison cells for the night, we’ll...we’ll order some pizza and talk it out. Do a chill night with a good movie. I promise I won’t let Dick put on another damn comic book re-make.”

“Mmhm,” Hood flickers a pointer finger at him, “I’ma hold ya ta *that*. If I gotta hear about Tony Stark’s *fine ass* from Iron Man 1 again, I might haveta put Dick over m’ knee ta shut ‘im up.”

And *no*, while Red Robin is giving Hood a two-fingered salute, revs the engine before he takes off into the waning night, he is absolutely *not* seeing that mental picture every time he closes his eyes.

*Not at all.*

# The JLA

“Batman,” is harsh and low, B’s normal *don’t waste my time* tone.

“Hey, tall, dark, and *brooding*.”

“I’m still a part-timer,” is his reply.

“Well, nice to talk to you too, Bats,” the Flash’s voice fills the Batmobile, makes just a corner of B’s mouth quirk up.

“It had better be important. I’m in the middle of something.”

“Define *important*,” Wally returns, “because I personally think our problem in the time stream might just be going past the important hurdle and right up to the *oh shit, this is bad* hurdle.”

Closing his eyes against the impending headache, B pushes his foot down on the accelerator, the big car flying through the city, “I’m listening, Flash.”

“Well, Flash 1.0 has been able to track some of these *ripples* in time we’ve been picking up over the last few months, and we think we might have figured out what’s causing the fissures, *but* we need someone with more experience in Time and Space than we’ve got–” it’s the Flash’s face on the small screen in the Batmobile one second. The next, Superman pretty much *shoves* the Flash out of the way.

“Hi Batman,” Superman sighs out, leaning over the control panel to watch the live action.

Shazam waves at the three of them on his way down to the Commissary for a Yoohoo and some chips, shoots finger guns to the room as the elevator closes.

“Hope you’re having a good night,” Superman braces his cheek on a hand while his senses reach out for a very familiar heartbeat, assured because it’s calm and steady, the only reason he’s not whipping out one of the Watchtower’s air locks.

“Hi Kal. I see you’re busy running the scans I left for you.”

Wally shakes out his shoulder from the push Clark gave him and almost, *almost* opens his mouth to make kissy noises, but really. The only one that can give them crap about their “work relationship” is Diana, and even then they completely ignore *everything*.

“Hey! It’s not *fair*. You get to look for new bad guys, track international terrorists, *and* find the bastards that hurt our kids! I get to stay *here* and-and run *scans*?! Even *Wally* has a cool assignment.” Kal-El straightens up, pouting down as the screen shifts briefly and he gets a flash of Robin’s shoulder.

“What can I say? It’s been a busy few days. Nothing I can’t handle.”

When Superman *sighs*, he can literally knock planets off their axis. Luckily, he’s only doing it loudly enough for B to hear over the video call. “I’m *stuck* here. You need to give me something *better* to do.” *Like, “Fine. Come to Gotham, Kal. I’ll find something more interesting for you.” *

“Since you put it that way,” isn’t even ruffled as B’s arm moves on it’s own to pin Robin across the chest as the Batmobile skitters like a skipping stone and rights itself. “I have two assignments.”

Wally blanches a little, stopping himself from just *going* to the transporter and running his butt to Gotham (B would probably throw him in another speed trap and who really *needs* that?). From the way Kal straightens, turns to look out the massive windows of the Watchtower to focus in on the Earth, he’s sure their super friend is thinking the same thing.

The abrupt screeching kind of punctuates the point.

Kal’s eyes don’t leave the window, “I can–” *be there in the blink of an eye*.

“It’s fine. I can multitask,” B interrupts. “Stay where you are. Those scans are important.” And the whiteouts in the cowl move for a fraction of a second, just enough to turn fully to the camera in the Batmobile, enough to catch Kal’s attention, make him pay a little more attention.

Beside the Dark Knight, Robin pulls the lever for the e-brake just as they hit the turn and Batman drifts through it flawlessly, missing another car by a literal millimeter.

“Wow, I give that a five out of five for teamwork,” Flash draws out, grinning.

Barry just laughs out loud from behind him because *honestly*, when they’d started the JLA all those years ago, none of them, *none of them* had ever figured the one human guy in their ranks would be the biggest bad-ass of them all. “Never ceases to impress, B.”

“Let me clarify: I *am* too busy for cute chit-chat. First, tell me what you’ve got. Then we’ll see if I can give three something more constructive to do.” B preps a few tool, flipping some switches, turning a dial while Robin releases the brake and the Batmobile shoots forward.

Wally nudges Kal over enough to see the screen, giving his attention to the Dynamic Duo.

“Yeah, yeah, okay.” Aaaand that sounds like something breaking, possibly exploding while B is absolutely *calm*. “So, we’ve been investigating, but B. *B*, when I say *hundreds* that we’ve found in the last days or so–”

“The destruction could be catastrophic.” B fills in, followed by the sharp sound of metal grinding.

“We’re talking triggers going across the *multiverse*. From what we’re looking at, it could possibly start a collision, but we still don’t think we’ve found them *all* or any clues as to who is setting them or why–” another sound of something potentially bad as the screen of the Batmobile shakes a little. “Hey B, I kind of need your full attention here. We *can* call back later.”

“No need,” is the smooth answer from the Dark Knight. “But you’re going to need to do some leg work I’m too busy to do right now.”

“I’ve got the first part of that,” Flash grins, lifting a leg and wiggling it around.

“Hilarious.” But Wally catches a hint of a smirk under the cowl, “First, talk to Booster Gold. He’s going to have some things to show you once you give him the coordinates you’ve found.”

“Awww, *Bats*,” is the whining from over Wally’s shoulder because *honestly*, Barry can’t stand Booster.

Well, *too bad*.

“Once you talk to him, we’ll see if he can get us any more clues on the *who*. Next: we’re going to need more data on the meta-tech the Titans picked up from a new groups of supervillains. I have a feeling their somehow connected as well as several other things I’m investigating on this end, so I’m going to be busy in Gotham for a few days. At least one of you should go visit the Titans while the Flashes are talking with Booster. Let me know what you find out.”

The elevator opens with a soft *ding* as Batman finishes up, and Diana steps out to see the monitors on duty huddled around a screen with a famous pair of ears sticking up over the cowl. She smiles softly, striding up to the control panel where her friends and warrior companions are apparently getting new intel on some of the cases their Caped Crusader has been keeping under his utility belt.

“A new group?” She questions, subtly sliding a hand under Kal’s cape to rest at the small of his back while she leans between him and Wally to look at Batman’s tense jaw. His straight-backed figure jolts once, twice, and Robin is looking in the rearview intently, hands on the panel of prepped gadgets. A grin cuts across his face when the following *skuurrrrrrch* means the car straightens out.

“Yes,” B replies, his jaw going tight in that way (*at first, when it was one of his Robins. Then, when it was one of *them*. And now when it’s about the children*). “The Titans fought a new supervillain group with some impressive meta tech. Not something we have capabilities for now.”

“You think it’s alien? Kal’s eyes narrow, his back straight, mind automatically working on some possible suspects. Brainiac and his damn *tech*.

“I’d say...more advanced Earth tech,” B comes back dryly, and the leap of the engine follows, “but I need to verify with the genetic markers built into the gauntlet first. J’onn is the best resource we’ve got for it.”

“*Batman*,” and that’s Diana crossing her arms over her chest, warning in her tone.

“I have reason to believe a few projects are...*associated*. Like I said, I’m working it from my end. I’ll come to the League when I’ve got enough to start directing people.”

The three heroes turn to one another in a singular move: *future technology.* Another baddie with powers over time and space causing the disturbances Barry and Wally have been investigating. *Wonderful*.

And here is where B is completely *aware* of why he’s the strategist of this bunch, “we can assume the tech doesn’t cause permanent damage. Well, that we know of *so far*. Superboy seems to have recovered anyway.”

He turns away from the view to say to Robin, *“no, missiles aren’t necessary. That one is oil, that one is sharps to blow tires. Don’t worry, you’ll get them all eventually.”*

But Superman snaps to the monitor, arms dropping to his sides, “what’s that!? Kon-El is *recovered?*”

“And,” B continues, “Wonder Girl is to be commended de-arming it after a hard fight with Bloody Mary.”

Diana’s eyes widen, “by *Hera*. Is she all right?!” A wrinkle of annoyance because she did not receive any calls about a fight. Yet again.

“The usual from what I could see,” B replies honestly. “I haven’t watched the feed, but I’m sure it was brutal enough to earn the contusions.”

“And Kon?” Clark demands, leaning down over the video screen.

“...scans look good. Him? Not so much.”

Coming up through the floor, J’onn shakes his head at Batman’s antics, and takes a firm place in front of the monitor, solidifying. He isn’t *smiling* necessarily when he waves the two mentors away.

“Go. Check on them and assure yourselves of their well-being. I will begin fulfilling Batman’s request.”

“Thanks J’onn. B, call you later!” Is Clark before he’s *gone*.

“Call us if you need more hands,” Diana is next, floating a second to wave before she takes off.

“That’s our cue,” Barry punches Wally’s shoulder, “let’s go try to get through Booster’s ego and find out something concrete.”

The Flash grins, glances back at the screen, still marvelling at how well B knew all of them to say the right things and get them all moving as necessary. “You heard the guy. We’re on our way, too. Hit you later, B!”

“Mmhm,” over the video call as Robin flips a switch, looking at the rearview camera, crowing with success. The sound of sirens is almost on them now.

A *whoosh* and the two are gone–

–in a *flash*.

Alone with the driving vigilante and his partner in the car, J’onn smirks from the control room, “very devious of you, Bruce.”

“Just reporting in.”

“Mmhm. I suppose you will tell me next you were not aware the genetic markers possibly belong to our most junior members.”

“The gauntlet used those markers, J’onn. That’s what they *did*, why they kept them alive.”

“...I know, Bruce. We will find them, and we will stop them.”

“Not if I get there first.”

The Martian laughs, “I suppose a compromise is in order. Allow me to send some of our people to the labs still functioning. Perhaps we can begin shutting them down before *more* weaponry is made.”

“And none of you think I can compromise.”

“It isn’t a secret you would rather work...on your own time.”

“Who doesn’t?”

“Hmm,” the Martian is smiling against his better judgement, working the control panel to start pulling analysis from Titans’ Tower.

“I have something else for you.”

And the ride has smoothed out, the car shifting with flawless precision and the sounds of police, fire, and safety squad gets further and further away.

“Oh? I hope it’s something more interesting than talking to Booster Gold.”

“It is. I actually like you.”

“As if I would believe otherwise.”

“I keep telling you people, I’m the *Dark Knight* for a reason.”

“When I see you ride a horse and carry a lance, I shall take you seriously.”

“I’ll take that into account. But for the moment, I need you to read up on gravitational time dilation.”

“That sounds a bit heavy for nighttime reading,” is the mild reply. “You have a theory.”

“Many, but I’m going to approach it from...another angle. Comm me with updates.”

The line cuts abruptly, leaving J’onn to chuff at the control board before shaking his head (and sometimes he wonders what they would do without him–honestly, *Earthlings*) in half-frustration, half-amusement. He takes up his seat, and brings up Google search webpage.

*Gravitational Time Dilation: Why Does Gravity AffectTime?*

Heavy reading indeed.

# Hood and Dick

Riding back into Gotham proper, Hood is already on his way to pick-up their wayward first Robin, taking a minute to *think*.

He goes over the evidence again, talking himself into what he’s going to say to Dick, how he’s going to throw it all down.

He taps the comm in his ear, “O. Need some deets.”

“What can I do for you, Little Wing?”

“I wanna know what the sensors in Red’s suit were readin’ ‘bout ten minutes ago. Just the usuals.”

“Oh? You think his injuries might be worse?”

*Sure, we’ll go with that*. “Could be. Gimmie his heart rate, respiration, alla that jazz.”

The numbers are good enough to give him another piece of evidence. Heart rate jumping, respiration quickening, temp stays normal, all of it *telling*.

And because he can’t fucking *help* himself, he smirks in the helmet while he takes the back way through Gotham.

“N is waiting for you in the alleyway two blocks from the police station. He’s already given his statement and the Commish gave him the next three days leave. He’ll have to do a psych eval, but he says he’s fine.”

Sure, sure. Hood is gonna see it all for himself later, yeah? Once they’ve called Timmy on some bullshit, put more of the bigger picture together, worked with B on the angles, him and his boy are gonna have a nice *long* talk about what all coulda happened out here tonight.

“I’m about five minute out, O. Let ‘em know we’re gonna do a swipe n’ snatch. Gotta get back n’ see what B has.”

*An’ gonna take a second ta hold that motherfucker *tight*.*

“You got it.”

And while he makes the ride closer to his boy, the Red Hood has to grin a little under the helmet, let his chest get a little *tight* when he thinks about what coulda happened when the fool used himself as a fucking human tracking device.

It means he slows it down a little more than normal when he spots the sheen off black n’ blue, his boy already in his nightly *skin*. The grin he sees while shifting down is white against the night, and Hood can breathe just a little easier even while his muscles tense, piloting the bike one-handed so the other is free for *this* little move.

Because Nightwing just leaps, hands reaching out, reckelss as all fuck, Hood guns the bike, standing up on it to be tall enough to catch N’s hand, working with the momentum of the older vigilante’s jump without losing his balance and landing them in the damn street.

Hitting the throttle with N’s fine ass right behind him, the Ducati between their thighs takes off like a shot, maneuvering through traffic like a blur. N picks the spare bike helmet off the back one-handed and wiggles the other under the leather jacket and holsters, palm flat on the armor over Hood’s heart.

With the helmet on, Nightwing taps the comm link on with a finger, “so? Good night for Team Bats–”

“Later,” Hood interrupts, smoothly taking a turn, moving his free hand to grip N’s thigh, “you n’ me are gonna have it *out*, Baby Boy.”

“C’mon, that was a fantastic plan!”

“What part a’ *we’re tryin’ *ta keep the Bats from gettin’ their asses handed to ‘em ain’t you on board with?”

“I know! Honey, I *know*–”

“Been up B’s ass fer almost a *year*, Dick.”

“*Yes*, Jay. I’m aware.”

“An’ ya don’t think that last ‘bout with Crane gas, one what almost took ya *out*, didn’t gimmie *nightmares* fer a month?”

And something underlying that tone gives N pause, makes his helmet turn a little more into the side of the Red Hood’s.

After a second of radio silence, Hood directs the Ducati into the alley, pulling it over to let the motor idle.

Nightwing throws his leg over and climbs off, takes off the bike helmet, dangling it from his fingers so he can face his significant other, “...I’m sorry, Little Wing. You’re right. I should have let you know before I jumped on the prison detail.”

The helmet turns away for a second and then gloved hands are deactivating the catches, whiteouts up on the dominio underneath.

Hood throws his leg over the bike as well, standing to put them chest-to-chest, sliding an arm around to pull N up against him.

The kiss this time around is the *Real. Fucking. Deal.* It makes Nightwing moan softly into his mouth, gloved hands framing his face when it’s slick and wet and *oh so nice*.

It’s long, *long* moments before the two vigilantes finally pull back, foreheads resting together.

“Stop scarin’ the *shit* outta me, Baby Boy.”

“I can’t promise that, but I’ll try to communicate better.”

“S’good ‘nough fer now.”

“I will make it up to you, *that* I can definitely promise,”

“Can’t wait. Gonna see if Timmy notices while B’s goin’ over what we got tonight.”

“You think he’s going to get all flustered again?”

“Hm. More than *that*, Baby Boy. Getcha ass back on the bike. Imma tell ya ‘bout it.”

But Hood literally grabs a handful of that ass for a *squeeze*, and soon enough they’re back on their way through the city, taking the back routes to get the hell out of town and back to the Cave for the oncoming day.

“All right,” N is saying, pressed against Hood’s back, “you’re telling me these gauntlets are just *giving* people Meta powers?”

“Right outta some sci-fi novel, ain’t it?”<br>

“I wish I could say DNA scrambling is the strangest thing I’ve seen yet, but well, *aliens*.”

“Fer the days it used ta be fear gas n’ joke bombs, eh Baby Boy?”

“*Right?*” N sighs, a little nostalgic for the simpler days when it was rabid crazies from Arkham and nice *normal* law-breakers. “At least work is never boring.”

“Could use a vacation. Some nice beach somewhere, yeah?”

“That sounds amazing, actually.”

“Yeah. Gonna make Timmers come too. Make ‘im wear a speedo so’s I can stare at that ass all I want, you feel me?”

“Hey, hey, hey, we’re not supposed to be pushing–”

“Oh? Ain’t we, Dickie? After ya almost laid one on ‘im back there?”

“I...I mean, I wouldn’t have, Jay, honest. He just looked so *cute* laying there.”

“Mmhm. Don’t I know it, but ‘cha mighta been *wrong* ‘bout not pushin’ it. I’m telling ya right now, swear it on m’ second chance, Baby Bird *wants* us. Can’t let himself believe, but he’s got it just as *bad*.”

He says it out loud because Jason Todd is a man what *knows* the look of want, knows when a man’s got to turn away, to deflect, to hide, so no one else knows what’s doing, so he can hide what he needs, what he feels, can hide when he likes what he *sees.*

And everything from that scene less than a few hours ago in Tim’s bathroom, in the Cave, under Dick with the vestiges of an explosion burning lazily around them tells Jason Todd he’s done a whole lot of passing shit off that shoulda oughta been evidence he and Dickie needed to get the ball rolling with Timmy’s fine ass.

The half-hard cock, the deflection when Jay caught ‘im touching, it was the final evidence he needed to believe there was more than the smart ass affection in their bird. And fuck if he hadn’ta almost missed it. In trying to be careful and considerate, in trying to avoid the shit that would scare him back out into the world or make him run full speed back to the Titans, all their workings to make sure Tim knew he was safe in Gotham, all of it made them blind to those little cues.

But now that he realizes, now that he *gets it*, gets where Tim’s been for a while, can take a second to run down the clues, look back at the smallest details of their interactions through the months, he berates himself silently on being a seriously shitty Detective, yeah? And it ain’t just the fact Baby Bird got half-hard just from a look. Naw, a lotta things that have been nagging at him, catching right in his brain pan and whirling about, shit he’d just passed off as wishful-fucking-thinking are starting making a whole lotta sense. The more comfortable Baby Bird had been getting with them and casual touches, an arm around his shoulders, a grip to the wrist, a niche right in his lap during the bad episodes. And Jason can mentally track the more Tim’s body language and nonverbal cues had unintentionally given him away all this motherfucking time.

He and Dickie are the dumbasses that didn’t take it at face value.

“Oh? And where is this coming from all of a sudden, Little Wing?”

“Well, might be Timmy wants ta have a *talk* once this case is all said n’ done.”

(Jay and Dick have *the convo.* “This shit is gonna happen, Dickie. I’m tellin’ ya. Timmy *wants* and we’re not gonna let it the fuck go this time.)

## Talking to Tam about the gala:pulled over at a safehouse. Does he need things? Maybe he’s in WE’s system, looking at something he’s been developing, hints the Triad will try going for him again?

He pulls over in the dark woods half a mile from the Cave entrance, and answers Tam’s call sheepishly, throwing the kickstand down to lean the bike.

“I’m *sorry*. Things have been–”

“You! Tim, *you* are going to give me gray hair!”

“I *know*,” he whines, standing off the bike to take some of the pressure off his mid-section. “This is some serious business, Tam. The people we’re hunting...I need to give it my full attention.”

“*Only* if you give me Thursday night for this gala. *Tim*, you *have* to go. Science and Technology is *your thing*, and *you* marketed it that way!”

“*Yes*,” he breathes out patiently, “yes, I did. Okay. Two nights from now. I can probably swing that.” Which means his time table just got more *extensive*. Fifty-one hours to analyze all the evidence, send various superhero teams to take down remaining science baddies, and deflect the Bats away from his own little mission.

He can totally swing it, not like he really has a choice. He’s already very well *aware* Tam will bury him in paperwork *hell* if he doesn’t show, and how on-the-ball with mother-henning the Bats will be if he’s found out.

“You. Had. Better. Tim. *Tim*. I cannot work this kind of room like you can.”

He rubs the bridge of his nose, wondering if there’s a headache in his immediate future. “Yes, Tam.”

“We’re giving away a *lot* of money. You need to be there to hand off the check.”

“Yes, Tam.”

And he’s already recalculating, the shipment coming in tomorrow night, and depending on what’s really *in it*…

“Tim? *Tim? *Are you still there? Are you okay?”

The shudder slivers up his spine, but a few blinks and he stalks back to the bike and throw his leg over. “I’m here. I’m on my way back.” He doesn’t answer the *okay* question because *really*. He nudges the phone between his shoulder and ear, raises up the wrist computer to check in on anything he might have missed during the drive.

(*Call from the Watchtower to B and Rob. They might be coming into the game sooner than he anticipated.*)

“It’s *late*, how far are you from your place?”

*Pause*.

“I’m...staying at the Manor tonight.” Is mumbled because *dammit, call out once for a little blood loss train and suddenly you’re suddenly buried in ****Bats****.*

Even as late as it is, he doesn’t need to see Tam to know she *perks*.

“*Are you now?*” And *damn*, she sounds a little too *smug*.

“It’s...complicated, but I will give you the details on our way to the gala. Cross my heart and hope to die.”

(*The shipment is going to be evidence he needs to tie the Triad to this. Once he has physical proof, he’s going to ride that crime fighting train all the way to the end this time.)*

“Please don’t say that to me,” she groans, the sound like she’s flopping back in bed. “But *yes*, I need to be caught up apparently, and our conversation will be full of all the salacious details, Tim. I *demand* it.”

Salacious?

“I mean, now I want to know what they *did* to get you to stay.”

There’s that smugness in her tone again, and he’s got *no* idea what she’s talking about. Good bouts of crime fighting are usually enough to keep his attention. “Blood loss is a hell of a thing, Tam.”

“I’m sorry, *what again?!”*

“I got better.”

(*It’s either other meta-creation tech, or...test subjects*.)

“That is so *not funny!* You know I worry about your skinny ass out there!”

(*Hoping for meta-tech.*)

“And how *hurt* are you? Are you sure you’ll be okay to go to this gala?”

“I’m healing, sleuthing, totally planning on not ditching you *and* sweet tech–”

(*Science and Technology Gala*…)

The plan forms quickly, and her voice is tinny, worried again in his ear when he suddenly has a *brilliant* idea.

“As a matter of fact,” is slow and sure, “you can have someone send an email out to everyone in the company that I’m going to be there to represent Wayne Enterprises and hand out the check myself. Because you’re right, this gala is *my* thing.”

“Oh? Wait, *what?* Tim, slow down–”

“I *promised* you I would be there, Tam. Add this to the weekly newsletter stat, and then I can’t possibly back out, right?”

(*The odds of this working are about 10-1. Hm, he’ll take that*.)

“O-okay. I will get on that first thing in the morning, and thank-you for being *responsible*, but don’t think for a second you are getting out of this conversation, Tim. Not. At. All.”

“I will give *so many* details about bad guys and getting my ass all kinds of handed to me. You really like those stories.”

“You bet I do, but what I *really* want to know is what Dick and Jay with his juicy thighs did to pin you down in the Manor long enough to *stay*. What kind of *motivation *would they would give you, hmmmm? Let me think\~”

The way she says their names makes his face get stupidly *hot* for a second, but Red Robin clears his throat, finally picking up on what she’s laying down.

“C’mon, I’ve been sleuthing all night. It’s mean to tease.”

“Am I the one who’s been *teasing* you, Boss? Or was it someone with a sexy accent? Maybe someone with the finest *ass* in Gotham?”

*I wish*.

Fuck. Stop that.

“I’m going back to thwarting evil bad guys now. Go back to sleep. Let’s meet at the office an hour before the gala and ride together.”

“Done and done! G’night boss. Try to get some sleep? Please?”

He laughs softly and ends the call, slides the phone back in his harness before kick-starting the bike and considering how this little plan might just *go* if things pan out the way he expects.

(*The last time, they had to grab him from Wayne Towers. The gala could give them an easier venue*.)

He might be blowing at smoke, but still, it’s worth playing CEO to make *sure*.

# In the Cave: *Now*

The soft sigh is the big car’s top sliding back, revealing the Dynamic Duo safe and sound after a rousing night.

Deactivating the cowl, B ruffles Robin’s hair with a, “good work tonight,” and shoos him off to the showers. A few keystrokes and the Batcomputer’s screen comes online.

The clock in the left-hand corner is a countdown, down to the last few minutes. If the fast hack is going to show him what he *thinks* is going on, then he’s got the evidence he needs. *World’s Greatest Detective, indeed*.

Red Robin is working the laptop at his workspace, cape thrown haphazardly over the chair, gloves and gauntlets on the gleaming surface. The domino is in the pile, utility belt still riding his hips, and the bluetooth in his ear lighting up lazily.

“I’m glad to hear it Cassie. S.E.A.R.C.H. is still running facial rec for the Insidious Seven, but so far, we’ve got nothing...mmhm. They wanted something out of STAR Labs, we just have to figure out *what* and we’ll have them...”

B listens to the conversation without making it seem like he’s eavesdropping.

“–his scans might all be normal, but I don’t trust bad guy tech on general principle. You know that.”

More tinny *wah wah wahs* from the bluetooth device and the Batman is starting to come off by degrees. Gloves and gauntlets, utility belt and cape/cowl combo. Boots and socks next.

Once again, Alfred proves himself a *master* at being in the right place at the right time, offering Sir a pair of sweats and t-shirt in place of the batsuit and armor.

“A lucrative evening I can assume?” The butler sets out water and aspirin with subtle grace.

B glances over at the counter again, smirking, “I think it’s going to prove *insightful*, Alfred. Everything fine here?”

“As well as can be expected. Repast is prepared, and all the young Masters’ rooms are prepared.”

“Mmhm. You took care of Jason’s room?” Bruce goes back to stripping out of the suit, putting on a different skin for the rest of the night. One that’s a hell of a lot more comfortable.

“Certainly, Sir.”

“Good. It’s not like he’ll be there anyway.”

“He did go to great lengths to make us believe the contrary, Sir. It will be a shame to waste his efforts.”

“They need to understand, Alfred. I don’t care if they’re together, I just want them to be happy.”

“Of course, Sir. However, simply moving some of Master Jason’s things is not as...*effective* in displaying your sentiments as simply talking to them, I dare say.”

“You know they get too embarrassed when I call them out on it.”

“Indeed, but it may do them well to know you approve.”

“Hm. Maybe I’ll say something to them after all.”

“After the boys are all back, I’m calling Clark again to go over the details. There’s nothing in the League’s records about an Insidious Seven.”

“As it appears, Sir, you may need to call upon another ally. Master Tim already has a plan for your alien friend.”

## Tim’s in trouble

B has his workout clothes on, and the logo on the big computer makes Tim’s mouth go instantly dry.

Well, *Fuck* would just about cover it.

“You must have forgotten to mention something,” B starts casually, *cooly*, “I thought I would give you the opportunity to tell us about it instead of jumping to conclusions.”

A litany of things go through his brain to somehow divert this, but well, the World’s Greatest Detective is five steps ahead of him (*someone had enough time to hack the computer in the repurposed BatPlane, dammit*), and there’s only so much his bullshit tech can stand up to when he’s got things like, you know, *Batman* cracking his systems.

Not to mention the Wayne Enterprises stamped box sitting right on the computer console, the one he obviously took from the men that kidnapped Shaw.

You know, the one with his trackers from WETMS just *sitting right there*.

(*It’s really all the evidence they need, isn’t it?*)

Slowly, like one of those horror movie moments, Jay, Dick, Dami, Cass, and Steph stare at the computer with the lines of coordinates (*the same encoded ones from those special deliveries he’s been tracking*), go to the tracker between B’s thumb and forefinger, and come right back to *him*.

“I can definitely explain,” falls out of his mouth while his pulse picks up and it’s a fight not to fidget like he was still *that* Robin just trying to keep B from getting mad when he found out how bad the night had really *been*.

“Oh?” Because Jay is arching a brow with a decidedly obvious frown, “ ‘cause this looks a *helluva lot* like those sons of fucking *bitches* ya danced with last year, Timmy. Even have yer tech still, yeah?”

And yes, yes he *knows* it’s his fuck-up, Jay. Fully fucking aware here.

The snap-back, the *this is mine, not yours* justification, that *yes*, he fully intends to handle it, but at this juncture, all the Bats could recognize the ticks, the barely noticeable flinch in his squared shoulders, knows *now* how they need to *handle* it.

“I’m going to take a leap here,” B starts out slowly, staring down Tim’s very, *very* still figure, “and say you were eventually going to tell us about this.”

Around him, the others are giving him the proverbial *stink-eye*.

His hands tighten while he stares up into the still motion image on the screen of the big computer. If there was ever a time to facepalm, that moment would be now. “Do I need to mention this really isn’t your problem?”

“You should have told us,” Dick cuts him right off at the *knees*, “the *second* you suspected it was the White Triad behind all this, you should have *said so*, Timmy. Dammit, I thought we were *past this*.” The itch in the back of Dick’s skull, the inner detective that had noticed things

And now they strategically start to close in on him, keep him from taking off, from taking the responsibility of it all on his shoulders and leaving them in the dust (even though he still has a *plan*). Dami is the first to ease forward while Tim’s eyes are on B, then Jay when Dick starts up.

“I didn’t have enough evidence to prove it, Dick,” he finally gets in, “I needed to–” but unfortunately for *him*, everyone realizes where this is going to *go*. As in, Red will claim to need time in his Perch to gather together the necessities and probably vanish rather than put the Batfam into the path of his own international terrorists.

Dami interjects, “as though this scenario is not painfully *familiar*. The partial serial number lead back to Wayne Enterprises and your tracking system. The question is: what is it able to *do* that it is desired enough to kidnap you the first time?”

“Like I said, I can’t prove it yet. Do you even *know* how many asshole Black Market traders are out there? The odds aren’t high, so I have to know for sure. I needed concrete evidence like a fucking delivery to Gotham Harbor with the same M.O.–”

“The most effective way to divert us is to use the word *evidence*,” is Dami, his expression twisted in something slightly *familiar* in that *stabbing is just about 50/50* category. “It will not work, Tim.”

Bruce, however, is the one that usually has little problem cutting through the bullshit, and since plan *Get Tim Back to the Bats* had figured out just how ineffective retreating when it comes to Tim and his terrible *tendencies* has come to be

“Whether or not you had anything definitive is moot. Your suspicions are on point enough that you should have let us know even without the numbers.” B just stares him down because *yup*, he’s been caught.

“The White Triad isn’t a Bat priority,” he makes it quiet, makes it take *root*. “It’s *mine*, and since I was the one that took them down last time, it’s my responsibility if they’ve come back bigger and more bad ass than ever.” He turns just enough to be looking at Bruce, “this *isn’t* your fight. The Bats have other priorities.”

“The point of this, Tim,” B stresses, “is that it’s *your* fight and dammit why *wouldn’t* we want to be there? Why wouldn’t we want to have your back in this?”

“*Because it’s my fucking responsibility,” *since that much isn’t obvious apparently, “It’s *my fuck-up*. I’m the one that needs to *fix-it*.”

(The proof he’s been waiting for it the delivery canister he’s waiting on. If the serial and shipping numbers are correct, like the Triad he suspects, then there will be human test subjects in it.)

# The Shipment: nightfall (Red finds the crate is full of pilfered WE tech; which is his indication the Triad is going to come for him; not to mention what Dami found out in WE)

## Tim needs his Perch to analyze some fucking thing (WE tech) of which Dick and Jay follow. 

## // Notes and pieces

( Later, with Tim’s force field around the trackers, it can be maybe thought that the Triad/Ra’s/baddies want the trackers to get the wearer through time with the force field.)

(^Note: research could be in the crate, putting the pieces together that the Triad was delivering all the super soldier necessities; the labs Tim hit have the research, either Dami or Jay have something to link maybe? Except for the test subjects/children that will be in the crates Tim is waiting on)

## The Architect

And sometimes–

Sometimes, she remembers *before*.

(She remembers dying, she remembers heart stopping, feet running, the *blip-blip* stopping for the flatline. She remembers their disgust when she came back, when her heart started beating, when they thought she didn’t have powers, when they thought she was *used up* because they *broke her* like a toy to throw-away–)

A *long* time ago, she had a mother who smiled and a father who smelled like leather and sunshine. She had an older brother who used to wrestle her to the ground for tickles. His eyes were the same color as her’s and Daddy’s, he had fewer freckles on his nose.

They were bright and beautiful and wonderful.

And a long time ago, they were *hers*.

It was the before time. *Her* before time. Before they took her from her family, from her less-freckly brother, her sunshine Daddy, her smiley Mommy, when they brought her to a world of cold gurneys and restraints of *pain* and “Do it again. Do it again. Do it until we say *stop*, even if you die.”

It was back when she had something so precious, she would give anything to have it *back*.

When she became the Architect, she promised herself she would do whatever was necessary to fix it all the way it should have been.

Through testing and screaming and agony and *fear*, her only consolation was the knowledge that someday, *someday*, she would have the power to make everything alright again, to get back what she’d lost, what had been *taken*.

That day has been coming. Long after she escaped the laboratories and tests and wicked people claiming what they were doing to her was for the greater good.

(And it’s wrong, so *wrong*, if causing someone pain all the time, every day, every *breath* could possibly be for *good*. It was all just more lies, more excuses to keep her strapped down, to make her stop fighting.)

But it’s *okay*. She knows what she has to do, how she can fix it, how she can save the world.

The series of traps in the depths of time she’s planted has taken a year of her own life, making her age more than she should if she didn’t have this power, this *curse*.

She’s taken time, so much *time* in planning it all out, on which events would need to be stopped or started, which events would flow into others, which events would cause others, which ones she needed to go back and trigger to make the explosion through the multiverse happen as it should, to collapse the layers all into a singular, perfect timeline.

The traps in the time streams are finally, *finally* all placed, are ready to be triggered. Her dominoes ready to fall.

Once she trips the first event, once all the next are set in motion, once the fractures over the multiverse start breaking open wide, start crashing each timeline down into the path she’s been setting up, not only will her...*allies*, the worst evil doers, the only ones she could convince this must be *done*, but their enemies will be part of the final downfall.

If she’s going to create a world without crime, without heroes, without villains, a world without *evil*, then all her supporters would be among the number of casualties.

Too bad she can’t make a utopia without breaking some eggs.

\*\*

The thing strapped to her hand gives a sick jerk, and her power is cut off from her, redirected without her will. And the sick jerk, the abrupt *drop* is enough to make her very atoms scream in *agony*.

She blacks out for important moments, her wrist burning and throbbing under the metal gauntlet they’d put on her, they’d branded her with.

And when she comes to, the man with green eyes, the one she obeyed (*only for the time being, only because he only knew part of the plan*), is staring down at her, cape flowing around his heels.

“There you are, my dear. I see we are almost ready.”

\*\*

## The family conveines back in the Cave

(This part. B and Rob make it to the Cave before the others and the time travel stuff starts. Rob’s in on it, so that leads to the future either before/after this.)

The communications network in his car gives an off-tone alert, incoming call from the Justice League.

*Perfect*.

“I’m still a part-timer,” is his greeting.

“Well, nice to talk to you too, Bats,” the Flash’s voice fills the Batmobile, makes just a corner of B’s mouth quirk up.

“It had better be important. I’m in the middle of something.”

“Define *important*,” Wally returns, “because I personally think our problem in the time stream might just be going past the important hurdle and right up to the *oh shit, this is bad* hurdle.”

Closing his eyes against the impending headache, B pushes his foot down on the accelerator, the big car flying through the city, “I’m listening, Flash.”

“Well, Flash 1.0 has been able to track some of these *ripples* in time we’ve been picking up over the last few months, and we think we might have figured out what’s causing the fissures. We need

\*\*

Everyone else makes it back:

(“I hope you were going to tell us about this?” section when all the pieces come together in the Batmobile. WHEN THEY GET TO SHAW and the WE stuff: “ah, B...remember that special project R&D was working on...when you came in to take me to lunch.”

“You were *under* it if I recall.”

“Yeah, about that…”

“Tim,” and the warning is there, the whole *give me the truth, Robin* thing going down.

“It was a prototype shield generator for the trackers. If the courier gets...attacked or what*ever*, the devices could project a force shield for protection, but *Bruce*, it was only in *testing*–”

“Whoa, you making some scary shit, Baby Bird.”

“That’s why we were going to clean-up at the Expo. This could revolutionize– you know what? I’m not selling it here, but the point *is*, no one should even *know* about this.” -From chapter 8 or 9? Something) (the crates aren’t on the shipping logs, that’s why he has to go to the docks)

(“There’s...a tracking number on the crates,” he admits hoarsely, “it’s the same pattern, the same equation, but B...*Bruce*, it’s different and I think...I think–”

“That’s why you were so sure you were going to find children in the next shipment.”

“The numbers don’t lie,” he argues weakly, “I...I found the same reference numbers at the first lab. That’s why I kept following the trail before it went cold. I...I didn’t have *time*, the Titans were out and working alone, downtime after the last run-in with the Insidious Seven! I mean–”

“S’ that’s why y’ didn’t fucking *call* us, Timmers?”

“No. I didn’t call you because I couldn’t prove anything concrete. I needed to have all the evidence, *which is what I was doing*–”)

Alfred doesn’t really have to say anything when Tim throws his leg off the Ducati and starts striding through the Cave to hit the big computer. The Batmobile isn’t back yet, and neither is Hood or N, so if he *hurries the fuck up* and finds a reason in the analysis from the Tower, he might have a reason to go back to the Perch and get his own plans underway.

(“Make sure it’s a ticket for one, Tam.”

“The only person I know with a more depressing love life than mine.”

“If you’re not married and I’m not dead by the time we turn 40, consider it a done deal.”

“Pfft, like I’d put up with you, even at that age!”)

He’s completely ready to access the breakdown of programs and security measures from the labs he’s infiltrated, to give a glance to the video files, the inventories, the “patient” rosters (*because he knows their real names, or what their names were before Genesis ever got. He knows and he’s going to find out who brought them, who sold them, who made money on their pain– well, he’s going to find the guilty part, and the JLA are going to have a whole lot of fun breaking out some ***righteous justice***)*, all surface information while he gets to dig a little deeper for *real* evidence to prove his ultimate theory:

- *The White Triad is still in operation, even if they’re under another name. They’ve been supplying baddies with test subjects, tech, chemicals, and research to build metahumans armies.*
- *After Tim admits to the Bats he thinks he’s dealing with the White Triad, they give him some privacy in the Cave to call The Titans. He lays it out for them. How the Triad may have been responsible for bringing their kids and other meta-humans to labs to make weapons. How he’s pretty sure they’re coming to Gotham, but with how well cloaked they are, how they don’t leave a trail, no nav systems, no radios, all kind of old school pirating, he only has Gotham log books to go on. But he tells them the plan, how the Bats are going to be with him. He tell them how the JL is going to be running down any more labs associated with the ones he’s taken down, are going to get any other test subjects *out*. But meanwhile, he needs to the Titans to run down the Insidious Seven and try tracing the gauntlets back to the makers (keeping his team effectively *busy*.)*

## Now: In the Perch

When he climbs in the window of the Perch, he feels like he can finally *breathe* a little. Riding the slight edge of pain from the injuries, Red pulls the dom, cape, gloves, and gauntlets off to be half-Tim, half-Red Robin and fires up his main system because time is ticking right the fuck down until Hood and N arrive to fucking *babysit* and shit.

The excuses he gave B about his isolate LAN is still valid because the White Triad’s code is still locked on his ghost drive, inaccessible outside his network, but also on the agenda is setting up his own plans. He needs to duck traces on his tech and make sure his contingencies are settling into place, and do something to keep Jay and Dick from being none-the-wiser.

The Tower is calibrated to expect his next incoming ping, and will send him alerts when the encryption cracker breaks lab files and calibrates location of the next shipment like a boss. He’s going to get his answers about how and who decided to break open the genetic code this week to make their own brand of super human. Not that he hasn’t been in *this* little sitch with megalomaniacs with delusions of grandeur, but the big difference now?

They used *his fucking kids*.

So, break the files, trace the other recipients, any entity communicating about the project, and hand it right over to the JLA, a proverbial *sick ‘em* to get the group of loveable superheroes out of his way.

(More details once the chapters flesh out But, say Tim is using the lab bit from above to find the remaining scientists in Genesis still operating and sending data about the Meta powers, which is what he will give the JLA to take over.)

While he’s frantically making final commands, shutting down the DOS terminal, the windows slide open and suddenly *Bats are in the hizzie*.

(*Nerd*)

He’s got tracking on his little *shipment* on it’s way to Gotham when Jay saunters over to his kitchen table to set down the Alfred provisions and flicks the latches of the helmet, shaking out the *stunning* helmet hair. Dick just flips on the television knowledgeably and ruffles his hair before going to make coffee (*and he’s not imagining it, how long Dick’s fingers lingered on the back of his neck, tracing over his pulse before pulling away*).

It hits him how they move around his kitchen to put food away and take off pieces of suits, call out to him with witty banter or demands if he *really did eat, Timmy*. It just *hits him* how far they’ve come when none of this is strange anymore, when it’s all just settled into some new *normal*.

The Twilight Zone has nothing on the moment he finally *gets it*.

(*Welcome Home*)

“Tim?” Fingers wave in front of his face, and he’s been staring at the screen for a few long minutes, not doing anything. “Gettin’ light on yer feet? Prolly need ta sit down, give it a minute, yeah?”

He registers Jay’s hand on his bicep, steering him to the sloppy couch while Dick comes back with just a little bit of *heaven* in his favorite mug.

“Didn’t even get out of the suit, Baby Bird,” the older vigilante admonishes, putting the mug down on the coffee table, completely out of reach of his grabby hands. “We’re going to get your parameters done and get some sleep. We’ll need for tomorrow night when your shipment of baddie equipment comes in.”

“I set up the alerts and scans,” he comes back petulantly, “which means I deserve coffee and Dr. Who until I pass out.”

“Firefly instead,” Jay counters fondly, sliding beside him on the couch, only in the bodysuit and boots, looking at him with a devilish smirk and twinkling green eyes. And he’s relaxed and so boyishly *handsome* like this that–

(*God, he’s so screwed*.)

–Tim can’t help but let his eyes slide down to Jay’s *mouth* and flicker his eyes back up, blink when he realized Jay *noticed* because the tip of his pink tongue sweeps over his lower lip *slowly*.

And *dammit, just dammit*, his face heats up a little, cheeks going stupidly *pink* with the blood because all the blood in his body goes *right* to his face.

He reaches over to get the mug, give him a reason to avoid looking again.

“Firefly it is then.”

\*\*

Not even halfway through the first episode and the hand on the back of the couch has subtly moved enough to lay lightly on the back of his neck. Since he’s starting to slightly waver, relaxed and partly-lost in the familiar show, he doesn’t tense up, eyes falling half-mast when Dick’s fingers slide up into his hair, nails lightly scraping at his scalp.

Jay’s leg thrown over his while the Red Hood lounges to the side, shifts slightly to nudge his knees further apart so the back of his thigh is a warm weight–

Right against his cock.

*That* wakes him right the hell up, and Tim is up off the couch like a *shot*, an agile leap over the coffee table to land it at a crouch, spinning automatically to face them*– the current threat*. (You know, *Robin instincts*.)

“Whoa!”

“Timmy?”

And they sound *concerned*, but Tim’s eyes narrow when they exchange a very pointed look and shift their gazes back to him.

He’s fluent enough in *silent boyfriend conversations* from watching them, working with them, *knowing* them that he crosses his arms over his chest and straightens up with a little more *pissed off* than he had before.

“All right. I’m *on* to you,” through gritted teeth because *dammit, really?*

Dick blinks up at him, hands on either side ready to push himself up. “On to us? Tim, what do you mean?”

“Playin’ detective, Baby Bird? Finally puttin’ some evidence t’gether, yeah?”

Dick’s head whips around, mouth already open to say *something* to his significant other, but Tim cuts them both off *at the knees*.

“Whatever fucking *bet* or prank this is has been just *hilarious*, really. Good job. You both *totally* got me. So, can you just *stop*, please?”

Now the exchanged look is something more pointed, Dick is wide-eyed, head tilted like a confused puppy, and Jay’s brow is arched up in question.

\*\*

## (Here’s where the realization that she’s alive is going to take hold)

“*Time*,” Caro think woozily. “*Running out of time*.”

In the Watchtower, Caro screams out abruptly at the massive wracking *pain* taking over her senses.It’s a wave over her mind, a wave cresting, crashing, aching, burning, running, working, *trying so hard to make it all right when it’s always been wrong and it’s time, it’s time, it’s ****time***, and flowing back out and away.

*Time*, she thinks woozily when her knees go out and Karm, Charlie, and Leo crowd around her talking too fast, too loud, too *much*.

The feel across her aching mind, a red *hot* burning that is *so* familiar, so much that tears sliding down her face and into Charlie’s hair aren’t because of hurts. She’s had too many hurts for just *that* to make her cry.

No, it’s because she *knows* who it is in her mind, who’s running through that fast to be

Gone

The next second.

Her chest hitches with a half-sob while Karmen yells into the ceiling’s intercom for Mr. J’onn, for him to come **right now**.

Leo is kissing her forehead softly, gently, looking in her eyes, but he’s too fuzzy and the tears are making her nose clog, but she can’t stop.

She can’t stop. She can’t stop. She can’t stop.

*They’re running out of time*.

\*\*

## (End scene, Ra’s al Ghul is “running out of time.” He’s watching an experiment, watching the volunteer assassin screaming in abject agony as the gauntlet around his forearm reacts, the gravitational pull too strong, making his whole body shrivel up, making his vital organs collapse. Something about the WETMS Tim’s been working on almost works to keep the gauntlet stable enough for time travel--not mentioning time travel yet-- but Ra’s looks up as the terrified scientist tries to save his own life dies. “It seems I will have to change to Plan B. Delightful. The Detective will indeed be part of the plan.” THEN THEN THEN< the Architect shows up, she has a gauntlet on her hand or something good????)
